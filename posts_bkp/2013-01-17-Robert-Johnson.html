But it  wasn’t always so and there are two musicians who got me interested in  this music and ushered me to a whole new musical world - just as Louis  Armstrong kindled my passion for jazz, Robert Johnson did so with the  blues.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The  first time I heard his music, I was blown away. I only heard one song  and already knew that this is what I’ve been looking for. I was  mesmerized by the raw emotion conveyed within the song. I haven’t heard  anything quite like it before. The singing, the guitar... it was all so  powerful. And the reason I can remember all of this so clearly is  because nothing has changed - the moment I put on Robert Johnson, I feel  exactly like I did the first time I heard him. The only difference is,  that with every listening, I hear more and more nuances in his music.  Listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4up4VP8zjyc" target="_blank">Come On In My Kitchen</a> and how he plays melody and rhythm at  the same time on his guitar, and all the while he delivers this amazing  singing, like it’s not even a big deal. Or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It-tJ8DOjIk" target="_blank">Terraplane Blues</a>, where  it almost sounds like there’s more than one guitar playing (it’s all  just him, fyi). But maybe don’t even listen to that, just listen to the  emotion and the feeling of the songs. You don’t need to know anything  about music for this to blow you away, just be open to it. Huh, I get  excited about Robert Johnson, I need to calm down.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">So who is Robert Johnson? Let’s put on a song first, before we get started.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/O8hqGu-leFc/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/O8hqGu-leFc&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/O8hqGu-leFc&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object><br /><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span> <br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Of  all the bluesmen, Robert Johnson’s life is probably the one shrouded in  mystery the most. Robert Leroy Johnson was born in 1911, in a small  town Hazlehurst, Mississippi. He developed an affection for music as a  teenager and started playing a harmonica. When he was around 19, he took  interest in guitar and started playing that instead. Around the same  time, his wife died in childbirth, which made him turn to his music that  much more. He was learning from any source he could get his hands on,  and it was obvious that he was still just learning. His most important  mentor and source of inspiration was a bluesman, Ike Zinnerman. It’s  been told that they were playing their guitars late every night in  graveyards on tombstones, where no one would bother them. If he wasn’t  with Ike, Robert would go to the woods by himself, where he was trying  to learn everything he could about the guitar. After a couple of years  he started travelling around the state to play around different juke  joints. The musicians that had heard him when he was still just  learning, were amazed. They could not believe what kind of progress he  made and how his abilities suddenly surpassed their own.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Because  of his talent and because he played all the time and everywhere, he  quickly became famous around those parts. He played with many musicians  and he left a mark on most of them. He played in places</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: line-through; vertical-align: baseline;">,</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> where they requested all kinds of different songs, so he developed an  amazing ability, where he had to hear a song only once before he was  able to play it. He could be deep in a debate with a friend, with music  playing in the background, and without ever stopping the conversation,  he could play and sing the song perfectly afterwards. That helped him  with a well-rounded repertoire for his gigs.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Robert  had a big appetite for women, and women were crazy about him. He had a  habit of finding a woman in any town he went to, who would give him  food, money and a place to stay. His lust eventually killed him. One  time, while playing in a bar, he was flirting with a woman for the whole  night. What he didn’t realize, was that it was the owner’s wife. The  owner was furious to see this, so he put poison in young Robert’s drink,  which killed him.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/3MCHI23FTP8/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/3MCHI23FTP8&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/3MCHI23FTP8&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">That’s  one way of telling the story. The other (which makes much more sense,  if you ask me) goes like this: an aspiring young musician wants to  become famous and is willing to do </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">anything </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">for  it. He tries really hard but his desire is greater than his patience.  One day he finds out, that if he goes to a certain crossroad at  midnight, he’ll meet someone who can help him. And that’s exactly what  he does. At the crossroads he meets a tall dark man, who tunes his  guitar</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">,</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> plays a song or two</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">,</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> and gives it back to him. And with that, the deal is struck - Mr  Johnson sells his soul to the Devil, in exchange for the incredible  musical abilities and renown. He goes back to the musicians that taught  him to play and surprises everyone with his skills. He’s unbeatable. But  there was another part to the deal - a couple of years later the Devil  gets his toll. Robert Johnson gets killed by the age of 27.</span><br /><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/Yd60nI4sa9A/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Yd60nI4sa9A&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Yd60nI4sa9A&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">No</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> matter what story you believe in, Robert Johnson’s music is simply  amazing and incredibly influential. Apart from some testimonies about  his life, 3 photos of him and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OFWLO0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004OFWLO0">29 songs</a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004OFWLO0" height="0" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="0" /> (with alternate takes it adds  up to 41 recordings) are all we are left with. Thankfully, the depth of  his music makes that plenty.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;</span><iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=B004OFWLO0&amp;nou=1&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=FF6C00&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=767676&amp;f=ifr" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"></iframe>

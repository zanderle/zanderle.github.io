Otis Redding was one of the pioneers of Soul music and was truly  amazing. He had a signature raspy voice and amazing ability to convey  raw emotion. There are three words that apply perfectly to what Otis was  all about: Passion, Energy and Emotion. He’s considered to be one of  the greatest singers of all time and his singing style influenced many  singers. To name only a few - Al Green, Joe Cocker, Bill Withers, Janis  Joplin, Van Morrison and many others. In fact he’s number 8 on<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202"> </a></span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202" target="_blank">Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 100 Singers</a> of all time. He was also highly  respected by The Rolling Stones, who covered his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW-TtMKBCh4" target="_blank">That’s How Strong My Love Is</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puydDR7gRmU" target="_blank">Pain In My Heart</a> and in return he covered their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmnZRBTPzg0" target="_blank">(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction</a>. So anyway, if you know who he was, you know exactly  what I’m talking about and if you don’t, then please, read on, because  you’re missing out.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Otis  Redding’s first big hit was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqVrNK4uiB4" target="_blank">These Arms Of Mine</a> but the hits really  started flying about three years later, when he recorded stuff like Mr  Pitiful, I’ve Been Loving You Too Long, I Can’t Turn You Loose,  Satisfaction, Respect (out of which Aretha Franklin later made a huge hit), Shake and others. He mostly sang just ballads and  party tunes and I’m not a big fan of the latter. I mean, don’t get me  wrong, it’s all great stuff, this is just me being very picky. What I  don’t like about those tunes (like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohkFgdCE2yQ" target="_blank">Shake</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZxN9iQM7OY" target="_blank">Hard To Handle</a>...) is that  they sound quite simple, they’re done in the same brassy style every  time, so after a while it all sounds a bit repetitive. It wasn’t like  this by chance of course, it was simply because Otis really appreciated  the beauty in simplicity. On the other hand, I’m crazy about his  ballads. Songs like Pain In My Heart, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmLjbTBcdU" target="_blank">Try A Little Tenderness</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJUWn-26jkw" target="_blank">Amen </a>and  others are just too good to pass on. To me, songs like these showcase  his singing and his abilities to convey emotions powerfully. Listen to  Pain in My Heart and listen to how he sings ‘Love me’ or ‘Come back’.  It’s so compelling.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/158fwCG27zE/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/158fwCG27zE&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/158fwCG27zE&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In  1967, he recorded (Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay. At the time he was  already very successful and he was already considered to be a great  singer, musician and a song-writer but this song took all of that to a  whole new level. It was a breakthrough for him as a musician and it  pointed to new heights that his music might go to. But, just days after  it was recorded, one of the biggest tragedies in the music history  happened when he died in a plane crash. He was 26. I’ll leave you with  the song and the enticing question “What if”.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/UCmUhYSr-e4/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/UCmUhYSr-e4&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/UCmUhYSr-e4&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />P.S.

Even though I really want to, basically all my posts so far have been  about music that includes a singer. After confiding in <a href="http://mitrovic.co/blog/" target="_blank">my friend</a> about  this fear, he made a great suggestion: we would tell each other which  instrumental album to write about on our next blog post, and just do it.  It was exactly the kind of motivation I needed. So here I am, nervous  and afraid, writing my very first post about a piece of solely  instrumental music.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The  album my friend chose for me is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006GO9Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006GO9Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">In a Silent Way</a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006GO9Q" height="0" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="0" /> by Miles Davis. I  usually talk about the artist for a little bit, but if I wanted to talk  about Miles, one whole post probably wouldn’t suffice, so I’ll make it  extra brief. Miles Davis, born in 1926, was a jazz trumpeter and one of  the most influential musicians in the 20th century. For 50 years, he  basically kept inventing new genres and explored jazz in so many new  directions (Bebop, Hard bop, Modal jazz, Fusion, Cool jazz). It’s safe  to say that jazz today wouldn’t be where it is without him. If you don’t  know who he is, you might want to read something about him, as he is  one of the most important figures of the 20th century music. Or better  yet, listen to some of his classic albums - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmaQdPoWVGM" target="_blank">Kind Of Blue</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sVapY6JDu8" target="_blank">‘Round About Midnight</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38bShXrS7pM" target="_blank">Milestones</a>. Keep in mind though, that that is only a tiny  part of his musical career - what he’s created over the years ranges far  beyond these three albums.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B1a2Tm9SnFk/UWctVDOlvKI/AAAAAAAABTY/-svjWC-iVoo/s1600/miles-davis-by-jan-persson.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B1a2Tm9SnFk/UWctVDOlvKI/AAAAAAAABTY/-svjWC-iVoo/s1600/miles-davis-by-jan-persson.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">When  I first started listening to jazz and heard about Miles Davis, I just  didn’t get it why he’s supposed to be so good. Sure, I liked Kind Of  Blue, but that’s about it. It was making me kind of annoyed, that  everyone was praising him so much. I thought he was overrated and was  frustrated that no one else saw that. Even with this opinion, I didn’t  think his early stuff was bad or anything, whereas the weird fusion  thingy, I just couldn’t take. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7mHNEA7z2U" target="_blank">weird appearance</a> on stage didn’t help  with that. So, very early on, I decided that I don’t really care for  Miles Davis and that I hate jazz fusion.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Four  years of listening to jazz (but avoiding Miles and anything similar)  later, I suddenly found myself getting more and more interested in  Bebop, Avant-Garde, Modern jazz, all the stuff I thought I didn’t like.  Just like that, Miles’ music eventually crept back to me after all that  time. I gave the albums I knew, another listen and was surprised that  this was the same music as the kind I used to dislike. It sounded  differently. I loved it! There were so many beautiful things happening  in the music and I couldn’t understand how I couldn’t hear that before.  Even though I had evidence against me, I kept my skepticism against  Miles.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">So  when my friend asked me to write about Miles Davis’ album, you can  imagine how I was unsure about that. I thought to myself “how on earth  am I going to write about this?? I’m probably not even going to like  it”. Nevertheless, I decided that, for once in my life, I’ll get out of  my own way, and agreed on the choice. It turns out, I LOVE the album!  It’s one of the most intriguing things I’ve ever heard. As if that  wasn’t enough of a surprise, I found out that In A Silent Way is  supposed to be the first fusion album Miles recorded. . . I was  confused, “Wait, aren’t I suppose to hate fusion jazz? But this sounds  so good. How come?”. After a few seconds of thinking about it, the music  took over and it didn’t matter anymore.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmQwzAsOw1k" target="_blank">The album</a> itself is wonderful! It’s dreamy, contemplative, other-worldly,  melancholic, magical and even dark. I don’t know if I’ve mentioned this  before, but I’ve always been fascinated by dreams and everything related  to them. So it’s probably just me, but I feel like this whole album is  about dreams, which is why I absolutely love it.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The  first song, Shhh/Peaceful, starts off with just the drums, organ,  piano, bass and guitar letting you look around and get the feeling of  what the song is going to look like. They set the stage for Miles, and  when he comes in, he glides on top of that background, as smooth as  ever. Listen to his tone and articulation. He’s got such control over  his instrument, it sounds like it’s not just a trumpet, but an extension  of his thoughts.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The  song then goes on and develops like dreams do. And you know how in  dreams something’s always off and even though you’re somehow aware of  it, everything feels just right anyway. Well, listen how the drums  provide a really groovy and quite powerful beat, but the music itself is  so mellow and gentle. At first it sounds a bit off, but after awhile it  just feels right.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Another  correlation between this song and dreams is how many details the sound  has. No matter where you look, there’s always a detail you didn’t hear  before.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The song continues making an impression like that until, just after becoming slightly turbulent, it rolls off.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At this point, I was already totally in awe, but there was another part, just as good as the first one. What a treat!</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The  second song, In a Silent Way/It’s About That Time, begins so darn  beautifully! It sounds so optimistic and hopeful, something like a  beautiful landscape after a storm. After you get a chance to really hear  this gorgeous sound, the flow changes quite abruptly and they start  building on top of that. It feels like this beautiful music is delicate  and sensitive, since after a slight change, everything follows. I guess  it sounds like, what I think a development of an idea in someone’s mind  would sound like - from that first inkling to a full-blown idea. In any  case, an amazing second part to this unbelievable album. </span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Listening  to and thinking about this album was a really wonderful experience. I  sat in a cozy chair, dimmed the lights and set the music to a  comfortable volume. Then I listened. . . I mean really listened. I was  shocked by how many things I could actually hear. If I had listened to  this about a year ago, I would have thought it’s nonsense. I guess I  must have had some kind of invisible earplugs in my ears.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Forty  minutes of this dreamy music went by like four minutes. The whole album  is filled with so many thoughts, feelings and emotions, I found myself  thinking about it for some time after it stopped playing. And I love how  great music inspires me to listen to even more music, which is exactly  what happened in the next few days.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I  suggest you give In a Silent Way a listen as well. Don’t think about it  too much, just listen and let yourself feel the wonders of music.</span></div>

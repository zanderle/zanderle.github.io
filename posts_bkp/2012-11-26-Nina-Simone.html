I mean, it is my women in jazz series and she definitely  deserves a spot! I will do another post on her, once I get to know her a  bit more, which will happen soon, because I’m quite intrigued by her.  The way she takes on some of the songs is very interesting and her voice  takes a bit of getting used to, I think, but after that, it becomes  great. It is puzzling but is also rewarding because of that. Another  thing I like about her music is that she fills it with raw emotion.  Sometimes you can’t quite put your finger on it, but you can just feel  something strong.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Here  are a few examples of my favourite Nina Simone songs. I love her  version of ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDprYZ-tgiA" target="_blank">I Put a Spell On You</a>’, I feel it’s the best one (and there  are many versions of the song out there). I enjoy the genius irony in ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TarrSrx4v0" target="_blank">I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free</a>’ - the music is so cheerful,  but there’s absolutely nothing cheerful about the lyrics. And because I  didn’t want to put too many examples in this post I decided for only one  more song. I feel ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlN1VR4K-Sk" target="_blank">Nobody’s Fault But Mine</a>’ is a good example of what I  was saying about raw emotion. The singing and the backing piano (which  she plays by herself of course) just gets to you. I’ve listened to the  song so many times, but it still grabs me every time, because I can’t  quite get to the bottom of it.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I can’t wait to do a longer post on Nina Simone. Until then, any thoughts on her or her music?</span>

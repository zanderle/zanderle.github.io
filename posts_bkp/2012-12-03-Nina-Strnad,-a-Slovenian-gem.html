Today I’ll write  about a young Slovenian jazz singer. Most of the musicians I listen to  are from abroad and are unfortunately not alive anymore, so writing  about a young Slovenian singer is something quite different.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I  still remember the day I first heard <a href="http://www.ninastrnad.com/">Nina Strnad</a> singing. I was  watching television to kill some time and I was rushing through the  channels to find something entertaining. All of a sudden I realized I  passed something which was completely different than all the soap  operas, commercials and low-budget movies on other channels. It felt  like a snowball hit me. I stopped browsing, thinking “what was that?!”. I  backed up a few channels and started listening to some kind of a  concert. I turned on the volume and this beautiful, clear voice started  coming out of the speakers. I was mesmerized by this girl’s singing and  shocked that we have this voice in Slovenia and that I hadn’t heard  about her. Immediately I wanted to find out who she was and I got so  excited that I found some new music to listen to (I explained why  I get so excited over new music in <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/eric-clapton-wynton-marsalis-play-blues.html">this post</a>). After that, I started  paying attention to her name and whenever I heard she’s playing  somewhere, I’d try to go and listen. She was (and still is) just too  good to pass on.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After  a couple of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUZIQM8PvQw">concerts and jam sessions this year</a>, I really got into her  singing and now I always make sure I don’t miss her gigs, and I always  recommend her to my friends - if you ever have a chance to hear her  sing, take it! You won’t be sorry. At the moment, Nina is studying jazz  singing in USA, so any readers from that area, pay attention to her  name, and try to catch her gigs if she’ll have any.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This  year she started performing some known popular, although older,  Slovenian songs, but with a jazzy twist, which is just wonderful. I knew  most of these songs before, but I feel like I’m hearing them for the  first time when she does them. I really appreciate that she’s doing her  own thing with these Slovenian songs instead of doing just jazz  standards.</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--K1SWflnb5Q/ULv2CX_8P1I/AAAAAAAABO4/WC4eyVFj8SQ/s1600/231112_0033.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--K1SWflnb5Q/ULv2CX_8P1I/AAAAAAAABO4/WC4eyVFj8SQ/s320/231112_0033.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Nina's gig by Žan Anderle</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Last  week, she came home because of Thanksgiving in the States and had a  concert at Ljubljana’s castle, which was the inspiration for this  post (and it just so happened that it coincided with my writing about  women). Surprisingly, she sang a lot of songs she had never sung before  and it was just spectacular. Unfortunately, none of these songs are  online yet, but I’ll do another post as soon as they are. The whole  concert was amazing but three of my favourite songs were Four Brothers  with its nerve-wrecking tempo (for anyone who knows the song - she  actually sang all the lyrics!), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rkNBH5fbMk">Chaplin’s Smile</a> with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09iyNDosdCA">beautiful Slovene translation</a> (which she did by herself) and most of all Thelonious  Monk’s In Walked Bud. I love Thelonious Monk and I love this song and I  feel like she sang it exactly the way it was supposed to be sung. I was  trying to find a version which would resemble her performance, but  without any luck. The closest, I would say, is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxdEYbMuA8s">Carmen McRea’s version</a>,  but even that’s not close enough. She was just that good.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I  genuinely appreciate the things she’s doing with the Slovenian songs,  but I hope she’ll also continue with the stuff she was doing at this  concert, because it was phenomenal.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I  apologize I can’t supply more musical material with the post, but I  wanted to write about her regardless of that, because I think she’s a  Slovenian gem and because she’s actually my favourite female singer, who  is still alive.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Thoughts, anyone? </span>

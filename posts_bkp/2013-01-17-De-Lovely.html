To anyone who’s never heard of  Cole Porter before: he was a prolific composer, famous for his Broadway  shows and his numerous jazz standards. He was something special for  writing both lyrics and music for his songs, which was a rarity at that  time. He had an amazing ability to come up with genius, funny, witty  lyrics, often full of innuendos, always accompanied by beautiful  melodies. Anybody, who was ever somebody in Jazz, recorded songs by Cole  Porter at one point or another in their career - from <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-first-lady-of-song.html" target="_blank">Ella Fitzgerald</a>,  Louis Armstrong, <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-mellow.html" target="_blank">Billie Holiday</a> to Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Oscar  Peterson and many others. And to anyone familiar with Cole: even if  you’re only remotely interested in Mr Porter, this is a movie you cannot  miss! After watching the movie, I started understanding his songs much  better and I started noticing more important details in his music and  intricate lyrics.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The  movie starts at the end of Cole Porter’s life, with the dying  songwriter retrospecting on his life, but observing it as if it was a  musical. It’s a great concept that fits perfectly to his life and music.  The story talks about his life, his indulgence and his very interesting  relationship with his wife, Linda. It features great performances by  Robbie Williams, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello, Diana  Krall, Natalie Cole and others. It’s truly a great biopic, which reveals  new dimensions to the irreplaceable Cole Porter. The only criticism I  have is that the movie starts and ends with a great rhythm, but  somewhere in the middle seems to slow down a bit, which makes it feel a  bit inconsistent. But seeing as how great the movie is overall, this is  hardly an important remark.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I highly recommend the movie to anyone interested in music or anyone simply looking for a good story. In case you </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">like  it, I suggest you get Ella Fitzgerald’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKYZK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0034JKYZK">Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook</a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0034JKYZK" height="0" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="0" /> to listen to afterwards. Her renditions are simply  beautiful and it’s a great way to start getting into Cole’s music.</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00067BBLY">get the movie</a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00067BBLY" height="0" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="0" /> as soon as possible.

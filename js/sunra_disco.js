Regardless of name, this long-player contains some of Sun Ra's most complex, yet accessible efforts. Ra had been an active performer since the late 1940s, recording with his various combos or \"Arkestra(s)\" as Ra dubbed them. Since this was the first widely distributed platter that the artist cut, it is often erroneously referred to as his debut. The tracks were documented by then-unknown Tom Wilson. If the name rings a bell, it may be because Wilson would go on to produce such rock luminaries as Frank Zappa, Simon and Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, and the Velvet Underground, among others. Ra's highly arithmetical approach to bop was initially discounted by noted jazz critic Nat Hentoff as \"repetitious,\" with phrases \"built merely on riffs with little development.\" In retrospect, however, it is obvious there is much more going on here. Among the musical innovations woven into the up-tempo \"Brainville\" and \"Transition,\" are advanced time signatures coupled with harmonic scales based on Ra's mathematical equations. Not to be missed is the lush elegance within the delicate, if not intricate arrangements heard on \"Possession,\" as well as the equally involved \"Sun Song\" -- both of which take on an air of sophistication in their deceptive simplicity. Ra's original LP jacket comments can be found within the liner notes of the Sun Song compact disc. This is noteworthy as one of the rare occasions that Sun Ra sought to explain not only his influences, but his methods of composition and modes of execution as well. As referred to above, Jazz by Sun Ra is arguably the most accessible work in the Sun Ra catalog, as well as one of the most thoroughly and repeatedly listenable."}, {"allmusic_rating": 0, "recording_dates": [1956], "author": "Various Artists", "title": "Jazz in Transition", "review_by": "", "release_date": 1957, "recording_locations": ["Chicago"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Jazz in Transition.jpg", "allmusic_url": "", "more_text": "3.

You can hear in Ra's solos and those of John Gilmore, Pat Patrick, Charles Davis, and others an emerging freedom and looseness which would explode in the future.

[Trent] Impulse faded out before the theme statement at the end of Blues at Midnight. [Webber] Originally issued in a comic-book sci-fi cover with half-naked ladies teleporting themselves; this is shown in the 1967 Saturn catalog. According to Bill Fielder, Everett (E.J.) Turner was the sole composer and arranger of Hours After, which was originally titled Stinkin'. Turner confirms this and says he had no idea that the tune had been released till many years later. Turner joined the band after Alvin Fielder (probably mid 1958). The sessions are probably from the later half of the year. Special credit to Allan Chase for recognizing how the odd cuica-like sounds were made on Ancient Aeithopia -- it's Allen or Spaulding on alto sax mouthpiece and Dotson on trumpet mouthpiece!", "review": "Throughout their mid-to-late-'50s stay in Chicago, Sun Ra (piano) and his Arkestra established themselves as formidable purveyors of a new strain or sub-genre of jazz. Having evolved from elaborate reworkings of familiar standards, Jazz in Silhouette (1959) presents a collection of originals, building upon Ra's abilities as a consummate multi-tasker -- writing, arranging, scoring parts for his band, in addition to performing. He stretches the boundaries of the music to suit the Arkestra, simultaneously progressing his distinct sound. Seminal readings of the quick and complex \"Saturn\" and \"Velvet\" are offered with unmatchable dexterity and precision. The latter title comes off like a confused version of \"Jeepers Creepers\" as Hobart Dotson (trumpet) prominently displays his unquestionable tonality. \"Ancient Aiethopia\" is one of the more involved works, both in terms of length -- running over nine minutes -- and the Arkestra's capacity for Ra's compositions. \"Blues at Midnight\" is another expansive (nearly 12 minutes) outing that, by contrast, is for the soloists rather than full ensemble. John Gilmore (tenor sax), Ronnie Boykins (bass), Pat Patrick (baritone sax), and Marshall Allen (alto sax) all shine behind William Cochran's (drums) solid contributions. Equally significant is the running dialogue Ra maintains during other musicians' leads, directing the ebb and flow with an uncanny fusion of melody and rhythm. Undoubtedly, this is a factor in the freshness the material retains. It is also a prime example of Ra and company in a transitional phase, prior to their full-fledged explorations into the avant-garde.", "title": "Jazz in Silhouette", "lineup": "Le Sun Ra-p, celeste; Hobart Dotson-tp; Bo Bailey-tb; James Spaulding-as, fl; Marshall Allen-as, fl; John Gilmore-ts; Pat Patrick-bs, fl; Charles Davis-bs; Ronnie Boykins-b; William Cochran-d.

The remainder of the tunes are from a 1958 session, and show the band moving away from straight bop and swing towards a more unique sound using much more prominent percussion and an increasing use of dissonance, along with instruments like solar bells and space lute. Most of these tracks were recorded a number of times in the '50s (check Sound of Joy), but arrangements and players vary from take to take.

The later Saturn jacket has William Cochran and Edward Skinner, and credits Skinner for the drum solo on Rocket Number Nine (hence all the discographies, including mine up to now).

Ricky Murray suggests that Skinner and Hudson were cousins.

Ricky Murray stayed long enough to make the Savoy session but returned to Chicago after 4 months, before the February 1962 concert. Patrick came from Chicago when Ra summoned him.

Hall Recording Co., Chicago, late 1960, except Early Autumn, recorded at the Wonder Inn around the same time.", "review": "This collection is somewhat of an oddity in that there are no original compositions from Sun Ra. That said, cornet player Phil Corhan contributes \"Dorothy's Dance.\" As the album initially surfaced in the early '70s, many presumed the recordings reflected Ra's concurrent combo and sound, which couldn't have been further from the truth. Scholars have since placed 1960 or 1961 as a closer estimation of when these sides were documented, using the rare inclusion of Ricky Murry (vocals) as sonic evidence, coupled with the fact that the effort was cut prior to the band's relocation to New York City from Chicago at the beginning of the decade. The primary (and most notable) Arkestra centered on Ra, Marshall Allen (alto sax), John Gilmore (tenor sax), Phil Corhan (cornet), Ronnie Boykins (bass), and Jon Hardy (drums). The bounty of pop standards and memorable melodies showcase Ra's spectacularly intricate and often underappreciated arrangements. The spry take of George Gershwin's \"But Not for Me\" is rephrased to spotlight the soloists' remarkable improvisational skills behind tight support from the compact and swinging rhythm section. Boykins and Hardy's brooding introduction to \"Day by Day\" immediately suggests the uneasy and inquisitive score that has been completely overhauled to express Ra's newly adopted sense of the avant-garde as well as his free jazz leanings. Seemingly disparate tunes and time signatures fuse into a free-wheeling affair that contains all the flair of Sun Ra with much of the same romantic charm of more familiar readings, such as Jo Stafford's (vocals) hit version. \"Holiday for Strings\" can also be recommended because of the highly stylized rendering. Rather than the mile-a-minute staccato \"plinking\" that often identifies the piece, Ra gives it a cool post-bop workout that discerns it for those otherwise unfamiliar with the song. \"Early Autumn\" is interesting from the perspective of the dearth of singers that Raaccompanied. Murry's robust voice proves a bit overwhelming, as if he might break into an operatic vocalization at any moment. Arguably the most memorable selection on Holiday for Soul Dance is the gorgeous take of \"I Loves You, Porgy,\" incorporating a languid swing that gently drives the backbeat, ably supporting the scintillating adaptation."}, {"allmusic_rating": "8", "recording_dates": [1961], "author": "Sun Ra and his Arkestra", "review_by": "Sean Westergaard", "notes": "Of Sounds and Something Else is misspelled on some covers as Of Wounds and Something Else", "recording_locations": ["New Jersey"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra (Retitled We are in the Future).jpg", "allmusic_url": "http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-futuristic-sounds-of-sun-ra-mw0000105771", "more_text": "15.

[Cohran]", "review": "Sun Ra's only release for the Savoy label is a gem. Recorded in October of 1961, this is probably the first recording the Arkestra made after arriving in New York. As such, you're dealing with a smallish Arkestra (seven main instrumentalists, joined by vocalist Ricky Murray on \"China Gate\") that's still playing the boppish, highly arranged music characteristic of the Chicago years (1954-1961). Ra sticks to acoustic piano for the entire session, but various percussion instruments are dispersed throughout the band, giving a slightly exotic flavor to some of the tunes. John Gilmore plays bass clarinet on a couple tunes (as well as some great tenor solos), and Marshall Allen's flute playing is excellent, as always. This album was produced by Tom Wilson, who also produced the first Sun Ra LP, Jazz by Sun Ra (1956) for the Transition label, later reissued by Delmark as Sun Song (Wilson later went on to sign the Mothers of Invention to Verve and \"electrified\" Bob Dylan). With the exception of \"The Beginning,\" all the tunes are very accessible. This is one to play for the mistaken folks who think the Arkestra did nothing but make noise. Excellent.

Not everyone in the Chicago band wanted to make the move, and since they hadn't been in New York long enough to recruit new musicians, Bad and Beautiful features an Arkestra that's been stripped down to a sextet of Ra, Marshall Allen, John Gilmore, Pat Patrick (who had already moved to NY), Ronnie Boykins, and Tommy \"Bugs\" Hunter. Aside from \"Exotic Two,\" the tunes are split between standards (apparently the last ones the group would record until the '70s) and blues originals, but there are indications of the direction the Arkestra would take throughout the '60s. \"Search Light Blues\" has some interesting percussion accents finding their way into the arrangement, and \"Exotic Two\" alludes more clearly to the percussion-heavy sound that dominated many of the '60s recordings. Sun Ra plays piano exclusively on this recording, and Gilmore gets lots of room to shine. A significant transitional LP, this is probably the last \"inside\" record the Arkestra would record as they forged new sonic paths into the mid-'60s.

Since they had only recently moved to New York (some decided to stay in Chicago), these are small-group Arkestra recordings. This is an interesting transitional album because you can still hear echoes of the Chicago sound in some of the pieces, but the sound is growing beyond merely \"exotic,\" with percussion playing an increasingly larger role and the pieces starting to sound more amorphous. \"The Friendly Galaxy\" has the same sort of mysterious vibe as \"Ancient Aetheopia,\" with nice trumpet and piano work as well as John Gilmore on bass clarinet (which he plays on a couple cuts). \"Solar Differentials\" has a similar but weirder feel because the horns change to \"Space Bird Sounds\" and Art Jenkins adds some of his distinctive \"Space Voice.\" \"Space Aura\" is built on a great horn riff, while both Gilmore (again on bass clarinet) and Sun Ra both shine on a stripped-down version of \"Love in Outer Space.\" Things head a bit more out for the last couple tracks, where percussion and reverb start to dominate the sound, as they would on several of the Choreographer Workshop recordings. This is an interesting album for Ra fans because it's such a small band and shows how new ideas were taking hold in the music, not to mention Gilmore's use of bass clarinet, which he stopped playing completely sometime in the '60s.

Date from Vein; personnel based on Simosko, 1967 record jacket, comments by John Gilmore, and corrections by rlc. (Whew!) According to Jacson, the album was released in 1963 (by the time he joined the band). The first issue had a blank cover and the old Saturn yellow label with black print (Gordon owns a copy). It is not known whether the album ever circulated with the ameboid cover shown in the 1967 Saturn catalog. In 1967, the album was reissued (still numbered LP 2066) with a photo of Ra on the front plus liner notes by Tam Fiofori and personnel credits. This was a red-label Saturn. The 1967 personnel list is demonstrably wrong in several places: it includes Robert Cummings on bass clarinet and omits the trombonists. Ra is said to be playing clavioline and piano. The liner credits Gilmore with percussion on Calling Planet Earth (he did sometimes play drums during this period, usually with Lex Humphries) and Patrick with percussion (he played bongos; trap drums only rarely) on We Travel the Spaceways. Jarvis is credited only on Dancing Shadows, The Nile, and Brazilian Sun. Roger Blank is supposed to be on percussion on The Rainmaker (Gilmore is skeptical about his being in the band then) and Lex Humphries on When Sun Comes Out (which Gilmore finds more credible.) The master tape of Side B is in stereo; all known pressings of the album are in mono, however. The master tape also includes a rejected take of an unidentified piece at the beginning. In addition, three pieces were recorded backwards (!) on the master used by Evidence: besides Dimensions in Time, there is a brief fragment with Allen's oboe, prob. Jarvis's drums, and percussion; the third item, Shadow World Take First, seems to date from a later period. This last was not included in the Evidence issue because of poor sound quality. Shadow World Take First (Ra) Marshall Allen-as; Danny Davis-as; Harry Spencer-as (solo); Ra-p; Ronnie Boykins-b; prob. Roger Blank-d; poss. James Jacson-perc. John Gilmore identified the alto soloist as \"Harry from Detroit,\" who was with the Arkestra only a few months. Presumably this is Harry Spencer, who was with the Arkestra in 1965. Title is announced by Ronnie Boykins. Rehearsal, New York, 1965. [rlc] There is a cover to Saturn LP 5789 labeled When Sun Comes Out Vol. 3: Sun Ra Arkestra Leaves Planet Earth. This is a variant of the generic Tonal View of Times Tomorrow. It is not clear whether it was ever used. [Gordon] Ah, there's more to this story. According to a Saturn press release (from 1963 or 1964) given to John Corbett by Alton Abraham, only Supersonic Jazz and Jazz in Silhouette had catalog numbers at the time. But a number of forthcoming LP releases were mentioned. Planet Earth and Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy sound familiar. So, probably is When Sun Comes Out Vol. 1 (but it's said to feature Ra on organ!). Music from Tomorrow's World is most likely Angels and Demons at Play. The rest are the famous mystery titles mentioned by Geerken and Stahl as \"uncertain LPs\": Flights over Jupiter, Rocket to Outer Space, and Neptunal Horizons (said to feature Marshall Allen \"on a new instrument imported from Neptune\"). There are also When Sun Comes Out Vol. 2 (featuring Phil Cohran!) and When Sun Comes Out Vol. 3! Most likely some of these titles referred to albums that never materialized; others may have eventually appeared under familiar titles. It is interesting that quite a few Chicago recordings are not mentioned on this list.... [rlc]", "lineup": "See each track individually. Recorded in New York, late 1962 or 1963", "review": "When Sun Comes Out is one of the first recordings after the Arkestra relocated to New York City late in 1961. This change of location also marked a change in overall sound. The New York period saw Ra focusing far more on percussion backdrops as opposed to horn arrangements (virtually everyone on the album gets a percussion credit), and everything from the percussion to the horn solos to Ra's piano playing took a more aggressive stance. John Gilmore's tenor solo on \"Calling Planet Earth\" throws the bop rule book out the window, and he is heard developing a more extended vocabulary of skronks and squeals. This track exemplifies the change in sound and focus from the Chicago days to the legendary days at the Composers' Workshop, where much of the Arkestra's '60s output was recorded. The band had use of the space throughout the day, and drummer Tommy \"Bugs\" Hunter was recruited to record the band more often than drumming. A steady rehearsal space and the ability to record Arkestra rehearsals surely helped lead Sun Ra down this more experimental path. When Sun Comes Out is a first glimpse into an era that would culminate in some of the Arkestra's most renowned recordings.

But When Angels Speak of Love, an album recorded with his Myth Science Arkestra during rehearsals at the Choreographers Workshop in New York in 1963 and released on Ra's own Saturn label in 1966, is very much within then-current trends in jazz as performed by such innovators as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. John Corbett, annotator of the 2000 CD reissue on Evidence, points out Ra's disdain for the term \"free jazz,\" but this is music that fits into that style and even harks back to bebop on occasion. Walter Miller's trumpet playing on \"The Idea of It All,\" for example, clearly indicates that he's been listening to Miles Davis, even as John Gilmore's squealing tenor suggests Coltrane, and, on \"Ecstacy of Being,\" what Corbett calls Danny Davis' \"excruciated alto\" suggests Coleman. Ra himself frequently plays busy, seemingly formless passages that are reminiscent of Cecil Taylor. An even closer approximation of a traditional approach can be found on the relatively brief title track, a ballad that, while not exactly sweet, is surprisingly sober and expressive. Of course, that's followed by the band chanting \"Next Stop Mars\" and going off in all directions on the 18-minute final track. The album's rarity on vinyl may be not only because few copies were pressed initially, but also because this is a Sun Ra album that is more conventionally unconventional than most, with tracks you could program next to those of his 1960s contemporaries and have them fit right in.", "title": "When Angels Speak of Love", "lineup": "Ra-p, clavioline, gong; Walter Miller-tp; Marshall Allen-as, ob, perc; Danny Davis-as; John Gilmore-ts, perc; Pat Patrick-bs, perc; Robert Cummings-bcl (only on Next stop Mars), Ronnie Boykins-b; Clifford Jarvis-d, perc (only on side A); prob.

The exceedingly experimental works are marked by the performers as much as they are by the compositions. The opening title track is an expansive suite of sounds adhering only to the boundless limits of the combo's sonic canvas. Each soloist is given ample room to propel the piece between the inspired Arkestra interjections, which in turn clears the way for the next one. This isn't exactly call-and-response, however there are correlations between the respective and (at times) disparate juxtapositions. John Gilmore's (tenor sax) maniacal wails are matched by Marshall Allen (oboe) and Danny Davis (alto sax) -- the latter of whom quickly establishes the cut's moody and schizophrenic nature. By contrast, \"Sound Spectra/Spec Sket\" commences with the percussive pairing of Roger Blank (drums) and Lex Humphries (drums) asserting unified rhythmic patterns that are countered by a compact melody from Walter Miller (trumpet). His regal nuances are tentatively met by Ronnie Boykins (bass) and then Ra, who weave their lines considerately, rather than in a flurry of impassioned abandon. \"Sketch\" bops freely as Gilmore forges a seemingly straight-ahead tune, until Ra's frenzied and ardent runs overpoweringly steer the number further out. Pat Patrick's (baritone sax) sublime contributions are at the center of \"Pleasure,\" smouldering with a measured and dreamy sense of portents. The long player concludes in much the same way that it began, sporting a full ensemble blowout on \"Spiral Galaxy.\" Granted, the selection is certainly not as abrasive and demanding as later efforts, although there is strident involvement from everyone within the dense arrangement. The brass and reed sections provide emphasis behind an off-kilter and loping waltz backdrop. All the more impressive is how well the material has held up over the decades. Even to seasoned ears, the music is pungent and uninhibited, making Other Planes of There a highly recommended collection."}, {"allmusic_rating": "8", "recording_dates": [1971, 1972], "author": "Sun Ra and his Blue Universe Arkestra", "title": "Universe in Blue", "review_by": "Sean Westergaard", "release_date": 1972, "recording_locations": ["On the road"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Universe in Blue.jpg", "allmusic_url": "http://www.allmusic.com/album/universe-in-blue-mw0001011261", "more_text": "52.

The opening title track explores some of Ra's spacier side, sounding a bit like a calmer alternative to his well-known \"Space Is the Place\" with June Tyson's ethereal vocals and the leader's ghostly synthesizer. \"Discipline '99'\" is a relaxed, bluesy number, although, as was often the case, one could argue that the band is a bit too relaxed and the piece does plod a little. But this is followed by a lively African-percussion-driven work, \"Hidden Spheres,\" which, along with the propulsion provided by the great, underappreciated bassist Ronnie Boykins, is a fine example of Ra's band at their most enjoyable. \"The Cosmo-Fire,\" the 18-minute track that closes the album, is a sprawling affair, a smorgasbord of Arkestra once again held in place by Boykins' bass, serving as a solid stem off of which Sun Ra launches abstract organ and vibraphone explorations and the rest of the band wails and sputters. Again, the performance is loose, but in a way that enhances the otherworldly effect that Ra strove for. Astro-Black isn't by any means the finest work by this musician, but is a decent introduction to his unique sound world."}, {"allmusic_rating": 0, "recording_dates": [1972], "author": "Sun Ra", "title": "Crystal Spears", "review_by": "", "release_date": 1972, "recording_locations": ["Chicago"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Crystal Spears.jpg", "allmusic_url": "", "more_text": "54.

Not only are the sides uniformly inspired, but the track list bears a few interesting diversions, including seminal examples of Ra as both a performer and unequaled arranger. The mid-tempo dreamy and languid opener, \"Spontaneous Simplicity,\" evolves around Ra's sublime organ and electric vibe runs. He places those against an unforced and otherwise limber wash of hand percussion as well as the understated yet solid pulse of Ronnie Boykins' bass. Ra's emphatic electric organ inflections herald the introduction to what is arguably the most haunting and poignant reading of \"Lights on a Satellite\" readily available. The flute section -- featuring Marshall Allen (alto sax/oboe/flute/piccolo), Danny Davis (alto sax/flute/alto clarinet), Danny Ray Thompson (baritone sax/flute), James Jacson (bassoon/flute/percussion), and Eloe Omoe (bass clarinet/flute) -- reel an edgy and trance-inducing melody into their sinuous lines. The entire affair simmers just below some glistens from Ra and a sax solo by John Gilmore (tenor sax/percussion). \"Ombre Monde\" (aka \"Shadow World\") dates back to the mid-'60s and allows Allen a platform for an extended lead that is sonically spurred on by Ra's motivated electric piano. Akh Tal Ebah's trumpet aggressions also make this version stand out. The truly phenomenal cover of Jelly Roll Morton's \"King Porter Stomp\" is a progressive score that builds on work done by Fletcher Henderson's definitive version. The Arkestra's compact presentation is stunning and Ra's complex score makes this flawless rendering all the more improbable. The bandleader offers up a vocal cosmic greeting on \"Salutations From the Universe\" which is swirled in an onslaught from the full ensemble. Ra's forceful keyboards are countered by some sharp and incisive contributions from the Arkestra. This segues into the benedictory \"Calling Planet Earth\" chant that is free jazz madness at its most effective. June Tyson's (vocals) voice can be picked out among the participants before Ra's brief solo conclusion. Although initially only pressed as a hard-to-find French import, Live in Paris at the Gibus was issued on CD in 2003 and is a highly recommended title for inclined parties."}, {"allmusic_rating": "8", "recording_dates": [1973], "author": "Sun Ra and his Astro Infinity Arkestra", "title": "Pathways to Unknown Worlds", "review_by": "Lindsay Planer", "release_date": 1975, "recording_locations": ["Chicago"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Pathways to Unknown Worlds.jpg", "allmusic_url": "http://www.allmusic.com/album/pathways-to-unknown-worlds-mw0000911197", "more_text": "60.

Campbell's liner notes in the CD reissue of Pathways to Unknown Worlds (1975) -- which is coupled with the completed yet initially shelved Friendly Love (1973) -- the record was likewise the final in a trio of works to have been mixed in quadraphonic sound. While the three free jazz instrumental improvisations are in many respects quite similar to the laissez-faire sonic free for alls that had become synonymous with Ra's concurrent Arkestra(s), there are quite a few discernible distinctions. Chief is the presence of Ronnie Boykins (bass). Much like Marshall Allen (alto sax/oboe) and John Gilmore (tenor sax/percussion), Boykins had come up through Ra's ranks and his brilliant and expressive offerings to the Arkestras had garnered the bassist favorable notice among his peers. As such, by the early '70s his contributions had significantly tapered off. However, Boykins' appearance on this effort seems to be neither lauded nor maligned. True to form, his solos -- as Campbell describes so aptly in the aforementioned essay -- \"inevitably make him a focal point of this album.\" Another sonic element that immediately puts the project into perspective is Ra's incorporation of Moog synthesizer keyboards, which began to augment his various combinations of electric piano and organ. His perpetual experimentations with the instrument's textures, and its seemingly endless array of frequency responses, provide one of the more consistent motifs on \"Pathways to Unknown Worlds,\" \"Extension Out,\" and \"Cosmo-Media.\" They would remain a source of inspiration and presumably amusement for Ra, both on-stage and in the studio. The Pathways to Unknown Worlds/Friendly Love (2000) two-fer also boasts an additional \"Untitled\" performance that had been dismissed due to a variety of audio anomalies.

Personnel rlc, with help from Hunter, who confirms his presence and says that cellist Alzo Wright \"didn't have the bass concept\". Hunter thinks Lex Humphries may also have been present on drums, but a second set of cymbals is not audible. Danny Thompson says that Alzo Wright also played drums. Thompson thinks the bassist was not Bill Davis; he says that correct execution of the 5/4 against 4/4 in Space Is the Place means it was a regular. He suggests Pat Patrick, but it's clearly a string bass. Boykins wasn't playing regularly with the band any more, and the bass is not well recorded, but he is the first choice. This would be his last recording with the Arkestra. Thompson suggests Griffin as well as Stephens on trombone. He also points out Ebah's singing on Space Is the Place] From a rather poorly attended concert put on by ESP to feature Sun Ra and other artists associated with the label: Randy Burns, Amanda, Buddy Hughes, Miamis, Donald Raphael Garrett, and Paul Thornton (of Godz fame). Tapes were lost for many years, according to Tom Klatt. Hunter recalls that the band started playing late and had to stop after an hour. Bernard Stollman also says that the Arkestra went on last. \"I knew if I put Sunny on first, he'd play for 3 or 4 hours.\" Hunter suspects that the tape was speeded up, judging from the effect on his cymbal sound.", "lineup": "Kwame Hadi-tp (solo on Discipline 27); Akh Tal Ebah-tp, flg, mellophone, voc; Dick Griffin or Charles Stephens-tb; Marshall Allen-as, ob, fl, perc; Danny Davis-as, fl, perc; John Gilmore-ts, perc, voc; Eloe Omoe-bcl, perc; Danny Thompson-bs, fl, perc; James Jacson-bsn, fl, Ancient Egyptian Infinity Drum; Alzo Wright-vln, clo, d; Ronnie Boykins-b; Sun Ra-Mini-Moog syn, org, declamation; Tommy \"Bugs\" Hunter-d; June Tyson-voc, dance; Space Ethnic Voices: prob.

Recorded in late 1973, on this date the Arkestra is guided by a musical theme composed around the idea of the Comet Kohoutek, which was passing close to Earth at the time. Typically, the release vaults between cosmic vocal songs that speak of Truth and other such brashly capitalized affairs (such as \"Astro Black\"), almost straight-ahead big-band jazz arrangements (\"Variations of Kohoutek Themes\"), and frighteningly evil free explorations (\"Journey Through the Outer Darkness\"). Much of the Arkestra's appeal lies in its ability to navigate gracefully through these moods. Unfortunately, the balance is too even here, and the band doesn't commit to any of the ideas. There isn't enough free music to let the listener become lost, the few Sun Ra compositions (in the traditional sense) that appear are too undeveloped and sloppy to truly appreciate, and the cosmic platitudes always worked better in their purely instrumental forms. An enjoyable listen, but not an important date."}, {"allmusic_rating": 0, "recording_dates": [1974], "author": "Sun Ra", "review_by": "", "notes": "Surely we'll never know if this recording really existed or it's only a hoax.

Aside from the two Sun Ra tunes (one of which had been unreleased prior to this), this is a pretty inside date with some major statements from Ra on piano and John Gilmore on tenor. Everyone gets a bit of solo room, and the flutes and bass clarinet add some really nice colors, especially on \"My Favorite Things,\" a song so closely identified with the John Coltrane Quartet that this version is almost startling in its contrast to Coltrane's myriad versions. Aside from the title track and the two earlier bonus takes of \"I'll Get By,\" there is no bass player present, the low end falling mostly to Ra's piano. Luqman Ali's drumming, as always, is remarkable in its tasty understatement. The bonus tracks are a wonderful addition. \"Untitled\" was recorded at the same 1977 sessions but didn't make the album cut. The other tracks are rehearsals, presumably from the Ra house on Morton St. in Philadelphia. They're two takes on \"I'll Get By\" with Ra on organ and the great Ronnie Boykins on a particularly well-recorded bass with Akh Tal Ebah on trumpet on one take and John Gilmore on tenor on the other. It's interesting to hear these rehearsals in relation to the same song's arrangement from a few years later. Although recorded about a decade apart, Some Blues But Not the Kind That's Blue is of a piece with Blue Delight: mostly standards albums that really put the spotlight on Sun Ra's piano playing and the tenor artistry of John Gilmore. Although the Arkestra is notorious for its outside playing and cacophonous tendencies, this album shows they could play it straight as well as anyone in the game.

The Magic City is an aural snapshot of that metamorphic process. Many enthusiasts and scholars consider this to be among Ra's most definitive studio recordings. Although the \"city\" in the album's title was thought to have been New York -- where the disc was recorded -- it is actually Ra's earthly birthplace of Birmingham, AL. The Magic City consists of four free jazz compositions: the album side-length title track, \"The Shadow World,\" \"Abstract Eye,\" and \"Abstract I\" -- two variants of a common work. These pieces are essentially ensemble improvisations recorded live. Any direction from Ra, indicating the order of soloists for instance, would be given either through his playing or with hand signals. Sun Ra & His Solar Myth Arkestra took up residency in Manhattan's East Village in the early to mid-'60s. Their neighbors included Pharaoh Sanders as well as Babatunde Olatunji. In fact, \"The Shadow World,\" \"Abstract Eye,\" and \"Abstract I\" were actually recorded in Olatunji's loft. The title track begins with weaving distant and frenetic lines from Ronnie Boykins (bass) and Ra (piano, clavoline), connected by intermittent eruptions from Roger Blank (drums). All the while, Marshall Allen's dreamlike piccolo randomly maneuvers through the sonic haze. The piece also contains an ensemble onslaught that abruptly contrasts with everything experienced up through that point. In the wake of the innately earthbound \"Magic City\" are three comparatively shorter pieces with subtle undercurrents that return Ra to space motifs. For example, the importance of sonic contrast defines \"The Shadow World\" by juxtaposing the lightly churning bass and cymbal into some surreal keyboard interjections from Ra. The Magic City also comes with an insightful liner notes essay from Ra scholar John F. Szwed, aiding in understanding the circumstances surrounding this piece of free jazz genius."}, {"allmusic_rating": 0, "recording_dates": [1965], "author": "Walt Dickerson Quartet", "title": "Impressions of a Patch of Blue", "review_by": "", "release_date": 1966, "recording_locations": ["New York"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Impressions of a Patch of Blue.jpg", "allmusic_url": "", "more_text": "30.

Bootlegs have used different titles: the Happy Bird and Magic Music were called Dancing Shadows.", "review": "Sun Ra & His Arkestra issued only a handful of titles on the groundbreaking indie ESP-Disk' label, and each title contains some of their most expressive musical statements. The eight cuts on 1970's Nothing Is were documented during live performances at various New York state colleges in the spring of 1966. Ra (piano/clavioline) leads the band through a series of free improvisations and more melodically structured compositions. \"Dancing Shadows\" evolves out of a chaotic brass and percussive assault with some extended inspired keyboard runs. These eventually nestle into a charming upbeat slice of extemporaneous post-bop. Front and center beside Ra are Ali Hassan (trombone), Teddy Nance (trombone), Marshall Allen (alto sax/flute/piccolo/oboe), John Gilmore (tenor sax), Pat Patrick (baritone sax/flute), Robert Cummings (baritone clarinet), James Jacson (flute/log drums), Ronnie Boykins (bass/tuba), Clifford Jarvis (drums), and Carl Nimrod [aka Carl S. Malone/Nimrod Hunt] (sun horn/gong). The leader's solos and accompaniment shimmer with many of the same highly advanced effervescent chord progressions that are worked into early sides such as \"Brainville\" and \"Transitions.\" Gilmore, Allen, and Patrick playfully blend Eastern-flavored intonations along with Jarvis and a second, albeit uncredited, kit drummer. According to Sun Ra scholars, drummers Jimmy Johnson and Roger Blank both toured at various times during the mid-'60s with the Arkestra. \"Imagination\" includes a brief recitation, after which comes a full-blown band improv. This undulates over a fast-paced choral mantra of \"the second stop is Jupiter\" -- a chant that had also been worked into the waning moments of \"Rocket #9.\" The slithery charm of \"Exotic Forest\" -- featuring a hypnotic oboe lead from Allen -- excels in allowing the mostly percussive contingency of the Arkestra to organically support Boykins' equally entrancing contributions. The short piano solo \"Sun Ra and His Band from Outer Space\" segues into the last lengthy side, \"Shadow World.\" Patrick streamlines his opening solo around the sonic swirl of Jarvis and Ra. The saxophonist then emerges with an unaccompanied blow that demonstrates his perfection in the context of spontaneity. Allen's solitary oboe borders on maniacal before eventually settling into a final free for all from the entire band. Nothing Is concludes with a mostly Ra-driven \"Theme of the Stargazers,\" which develops into an early version of the \"Outer Spaceways Incorporated\" and \"Next Stop Mars\" chants. Caveat emptor: these sides have turned up on numerous repackagings, many of which have been transcribed from poor-grade vinyl.", "title": "Nothing Is", "lineup": "Ra-p, clavioline; Ali Hassan-tb; Teddy Nance-tb; Marshall Allen-as, fl; picc, ob; John Gilmore-ts; Pat Patrick-bs, fl; Robert Cummings- bcl; James Jacson-fl, log drums; Ronnie Boykins-b, tuba; Clifford Jarvis-d; Roger Blank o Jimmy Johnson-d; Carl Nimrod (Carl S.

The first consists of shorter works Ra presumably constructed for presentation on the Hohner clavinet. Not only is the electric keyboard dominantly featured, but also it presumably offered Ra somewhat of a novelty as it had only been on the market for less than a year. The second side consists of the epic 21-minute title track and features an additional seven-man augmentation to the brass/woodwind section of the Astro Infinity Arkestra. Tracks featuring the smaller combo reveal an almost introspective Arkestra. The stark contrast between the clavinet -- which Ra dubbed the \"Solar Sound Instrument\" -- and the hand-held African congas on \"Mu\" and \"Bimini\" reveal polar opposite styles and emphasis. However, Ra enthusiasts should rarely be surprised at his experiments in divergence. \"Mu\" is presented at a lethargic tempo snaking in and around solos from Ra and a raga-influenced tenor sax solo from John Gilmore. \"Bimini\" is actually captured in progress. The first sound listeners hear is the positioning of the microphone as a conga fury commences in the background. Likewise, on \"Yucatan (Impulse Version)\" a doorbell quickly impedes what might have been a more organic conclusion to the performance. The original issue of Atlantis was on the small independent Saturn label. Thus the composition titled \"Yucatan (Saturn Version)\" appeared on that pressing. When the disc was reissued in 1973 on Impulse!, the track was replaced by a completely different composition -- as opposed to an alternate performance of the same work. The second side contains one of Ra's most epic pieces, which is free or \"space\" jazz at its most invigorating. While virtually indescribable, the sonic churnings and juxtaposed images reveal a brilliant display of textures and tonalities set against an ocean of occasional rhythms. Its diversity alone makes this is an essential entry in the voluminous Sun Ra catalog."}, {"allmusic_rating": "7", "recording_dates": [1968], "author": "Sun Ra", "title": "Pictures of Infinity", "review_by": "Lindsay Planer", "release_date": 1993, "recording_locations": ["New York"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Pictures of Infinity.jpg", "allmusic_url": "http://www.allmusic.com/album/pictures-of-infinity-mw0000886976", "more_text": "36.

There is a mixture of older works as well as newer selections on 1971's Pictures of Infinity. That said, even the established compositions -- most notably the full-throttled reading of \"Saturn\" that commences the collection -- are given fresh sonic visages. Tenor saxophonist John Gilmore is particularly potent with his flawless fluidity running melodic yet hard bopping lines over top of the solid rhythm section. He gives a hearty personality to his interjections as they dart in and out of the spiraling mile-a-minute arrangement. Bassist Ronnie Boykins is commanding, especially as his solo emerges out of drummer Nimrod Hunt's rapid-fire timekeeping. \"Song of the Sparer\" is an exquisite and rarely documented tune that begins with some intricate phrases from Ra before evolving into a languid and practically dirgelike improvisational piece. \"Spontaneous Simplicity\" is highlighted by some warm and inviting interplay between a flutist -- presumably either Danny Davis or Pat Patrick -- and Ra, whose strident piano accompaniment is remarkably suited to the earthy nature of the woodwind's ethereal, alternately liberating and plaintive sound. Immediately contrasting the more rural expressions is the aggressive extended free jazz attack heard on \"Somewhere There.\" The bombastic percussion and practically sadistic sax-and-drum onslaught thrash about in an almost definitive example of the sheer power possessed by the Arkestra. The \"Outer Spaceways Incorporated\" chant concluding this long-player is similar to other versions and remains an affirmative statement juxtaposing an inescapably dissonant introduction with the playful nature of the singalong quality of the verses."}, {"allmusic_rating": "5", "recording_dates": [1968], "author": "Imamu Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) with Sun Ra and his Myth Science Arkestra", "title": "A Black Mass", "review_by": "Al Campbell", "release_date": 1968, "recording_locations": ["New York"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/A Black Mass.jpg", "allmusic_url": "http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-black-mass-mw0001242177", "more_text": "37.

Recorded at Spirit House, Jones' house/theater in Newark, this live performance of Jones' dramatic piece dedicated to Malcolm X -- and to a lesser extent, the Nation of Islam -- would have originally only been found in black nationalist bookstores in a few cities. Fans of Sun Ra & the Arkestra may be disappointed, as Ra and company never play more than a few notes here and there. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make out certain key elements of the dialogue, obviously essential to grasping the full understanding of Baraka's play.

One Moog has a bass type setting, while the other sounds something like whistling white noise (wind?). \"Intergalaxtic II\" is a full freakout session, with both altos going crazy in the right channel, Gilmore's drums in the left channel, and the miniMoogs in the center. \"To Nature's God\" is just Ra and Gilmore again. \"The Code of Interdependence\" has Ra really putting the Moogs through their paces, although Gilmore also gets some tenor space (with Danny Davis moving to the drums, presumably).

Ra's playing doesn't get too far out, although the tones of the Rocksichord and miniMoog are rather humorous, and most of the tunes are quite playful. Davis provides some fine alto, clarinet, and a number of freak-outs, with James anchoring the proceedings. Davis and Gilmore switch roles for \"Impromptu Festival\" for a taste of Gilmore's tenor while \"Dance of the Living Image\" has Gilmore on drums and Davis on bongos. The best point of reference for this album is \"The Perfect Man\" off the Singles compilation, except \"The Perfect Man\" uses miniMoog exclusively, and Gilmore is a more solid drummer than Danny Davis.

There's just a bit of what sounds like bass clarinet at the beginning, but it doesn't last long. \"Conversion of J.P.\" is a less cacophonous, percussion-oriented piece, highlighted at the beginning by the flute playing of Marshall Allen. Then Ra's piano enters about eight minutes in and takes the tune in a very different direction with the same percussion backing. Ra's playing here is fascinating, though not at all flashy. \"Space Probe\" is a side-long tour de force by Ra on the miniMoog, and he amply demonstrates that nobody handles a Moog quite like Sun Ra. It could be the sound effects to a '50s sci-fi flick, no problem, or a demonstration of how weird the miniMoog can get. It ain't easy listening, but it's pretty stunning all the same for those with adventurous ears."}, {"allmusic_rating": 0, "recording_dates": [1971], "author": "Sun Ra & His Intergalactic Research Arkestra", "review_by": "", "notes": "Part of this material was published in shortened form on the LP MPS/BASF It's After the End of the World (see this entry).", "recording_locations": ["Donaueschingen, Germany"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Out in Space.jpg", "allmusic_url": "", "more_text": "47A.

The title number recalls Charles Mingus' \"Goodbye Porkpie Hat\" in its slow pace and elegiac tone, while the middle three tracks have livelier beats with playing that often answers to the style of fusion played by many jazz groups in the late '70s. \"There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of),\" the nearly 11-minute concluding tune, is the closest to more familiar 1960s and early-'70s Sun Ra, with its less cohesive lead work and the \"ethnic voices\" that speak, sing, and whisper about outer space. Lanquidity was extremely rare in its original vinyl pressing.

These tunes sound more improvised than others from the same sessions, with each player basically soloing over Luqman Ali's drumming on \"Jazzistocology.\" \"Of Other Tomorrows Never Known\" is mostly a fairly tuneful synthesizer solo until John Gilmore joins him for the last part of the song (Michael Ray and Luqman Ali sit out on this one), which has a surprisingly quick fadeout.

[rlc] Somewhere between 1976 and 1981 lies this mystery album. Hartmut Geerken confirms that it was released, as he and two other European collectors own copies. \"Maybe Saturn produced it in a very limited edition and they sold it while touring through Europe.\" Geerken says that the LP has a Chicago Saturn label (perhaps it is the last Chicago Saturn?). Stahl's discography listed it as a 1961 release, from the Sun Arts Club in Chicago (a place I am convinced is imaginary). I do wonder, though, about Edward Skinner (listed by Stahl on drums) because he was later known as Luqman Ali! Did Stahl take Skinner's name as evidence of a 1961 recording date? In any case, one listen will convince you this session was not made in 1961. Thanks to Mark Webber for sending me a tape. [rlc]", "lineup": "Ra-p, keyb; Michael Ray-tp; poss.

This is as funky as Sun Ra ever got and really must be heard to be believed. Side two consists of \"Seductive Fantasy,\" a lovely piece composed on top of a three-note bass ostinato that features lots of great piano from Ra and some interesting guitar sounds from either Skeeter McFarland or Taylor Richardson. John Gilmore gets plenty of room on this track as well and Luqman Ali's drumming is superb.

The band had been working in a more groove-oriented setting off and on for over a year, as evidenced by the albums Lanquidity and On Jupiter, with both featuring prominent electric bass and electric guitar. Sleeping Beauty picks up right where On Jupiter left off, with the gentle, swaying \"Springtime Again\" echoing the same mellow vibe of \"Seductive Fantasy\" from On Jupiter. A skittering intro coalesces as different instruments pick up bits of the melody, which is then fully expressed by the horn section and ensemble vocals. It's a simple two-chord vamp, with beautiful solos that seem to embody the reawakening and rebirth of springtime. \"The Door of the Cosmos\" starts with a gospel-like chant and handclaps, with comments from Ra's electric piano and electric guitar. A strong bassline enters, very reminiscent of \"A Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement,\" but the accompanying chant celebrates the mysteries of the unknown rather than the universal truth of A Love Supreme. This track builds in intensity, but never loses its groove or becomes nearly as raucous as the Arkestra is sometimes known for. \"Sleeping Beauty\" is the album centerpiece, taking up all of side two. Ra's beautiful electric piano gets things rolling, and the band falls into a peaceful groove before the vocals enter, led by the wonderful June Tyson. These songs are all built on the simplest of structures, and the playing from everyone is understated and sublime. Sleeping Beauty is truly a high point in an unwieldy discography, and something of an anomaly at the same time. There's a good reason copies of this album go for several hundred dollars on the collector's market, but it really deserves a proper release so more people can hear it.

This is the band that recorded the infamous On Jupiter album, and the slightly different band lineup for Sleeping Beauty (recorded just two weeks later) suggests that Strange Celestial Road was recorded between the two, based on the hybrid band lineup. \"Celestial Road\" kicks things off, where electric bass, arco bass and wah-wah guitar set the stage for a great June Tyson vocal and then solos from John Gilmore, Michael Ray, Sun Ra, and Damon Choice on vibes. \"Say\" has a great electric bassline and joyous horn charts, and swings mightily with a vaguely Latin rhythm. There's a fine electric guitar solo, as well as some more fantastic playing from Gilmore. Ra's keyboard sounds and soloing are particularly deranged on this album, but never get into the purely noisy realm. \"I'll Wait for You\" is the real treat of this album, featuring a great mellow groove and wonderful ensemble vocals led by the beautiful June Tyson. There's plenty of fine soloing on this track as well, but the main attraction is the mix by Ra and Michael Ray. There's a dub-like element to the way the instruments and voices are treated and mixed in and out, but this is dub by way of Saturn, and the mix is at least as weird and wonderful as anything Lee Perry has done. This is an overlooked album in an unwieldy discography, but it's a real gem and the fact that it's on the Rounder label should make it easier to find than many of the Arkestra's other albums.

Ra switches to organ for \"Images,\" where he is joined by a swinging horn section with prominent baritone sax and flutes. Then it's time for a fantastic Gilmore tenor solo. The beginning sounds like he's practically unaccompanied, but that's just a problem with the instruments being poorly recorded (the bass is particularly difficult to hear). Ra's organ joins in for the comping, but this one belongs to John Gilmore. \"I, Pharaoh\" is a side-long cut with that great mysterious vibe featuring wonderful flutes over percussion and a spare baritone horn line. Then Ra delivers a long vocal/recitation on Egypt and the Pharaohs. Again, sound quality detracts somewhat, but pieces like this, where Ra blends history and myth, are always interesting.

Recorded in 1982, Nuclear War disappeared until 2001 when the Chicago-based Atavistic label made it part of their exceptional \"Unheard Music Series.\" Originally Ra was so sure the funky dance track was a hit, he immediately took it to Columbia Records, where they immediately rejected it. Why he thought a song with the repeating chant \"Nuclear War, they're talking about Nuclear War/It's a motherf***er, don't you know/if they push that button, your ass gotta go/and whatcha gonna do without your ass\" would be a hit is another puzzle in the Sun Ra myth. Even with the danceability factor, without heavy censoring, the song would never be played on the radio. Severely depressed by the rejection, but still determined, Ra licensed the track to Y Records, a post-punk label out of Britain. Initially a vinyl 12\" was released with \"Sometimes I'm Happy\" on the flip side. Two years later, Nuclear War was released as an album, but only in Italy. The remaining tracks include four originals and three standards, Ellington's \"Drop Me Off in Harlem,\" \"Sometimes I'm Happy,\" and \"Smile.\" The latter two are highlights in their own right thanks to the gorgeous vocals of June Tyson.", "title": "Nuclear War", "lineup": "Ra-p, keyb, org; Walter Miller-tp; Tyrone Hill-tb; Vincent Chancey-frh; Marshall Allen-as, fl; John Gilmore-ts; Danny Ray Thompson-bs, fl; James Jacson-bsn, perc; pos.

In fact, there are no synthesizers heard until the \"Love in Outer Space/Space Is the Place\" medley, which is the last track. \"Blues Ra\" is a special treat; nearly five minutes of Ra playing a straight 12-bar blues on piano, accompanied by only a drummer and a bass player (who is slightly buried in the mix). Sound quality is quite good, and the band is in their usual fine form. As with the rest of the Sun Ra releases on Leo, it's probably not the place to start, but well worth owning if you've already been bitten by the Sun Ra bug."}, {"allmusic_rating": 0, "recording_dates": [1984, 1985], "author": "Sun Ra", "title": "When Spaceships Appear (Cosmo-Party Blues) (Children of the Sun)", "review_by": "", "release_date": 1985, "recording_locations": ["Unknown"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/When Spaceships Appear (Cosmo-Party Blues) (Children of the Sun).jpg", "allmusic_url": "", "more_text": "109.

The Arkestra would press them up to order and then I'd collect when I was in New York. We always paid in full and in advance to cover their pressing costs. Then came an occasion when there was nothing to collect; the Arkestra had urgently needed money and ours had been there \u2013 so they had spent it. I could hardly be angry \u2013 keeping the Arkestra afloat was a miracle at the best of times \u2013 but Recommended was also poor and such a loss was not really sustainable for us. In a spirit of generous compromise, Sun Ra gave us, in lieu of the unpressed LPs, the Cosmo Sun Connection mastertape, which we released in a small edition in 1985. This is the first time that this legandary recording has been widely available. \"Money from this CD will be given directly to the Arkestra, whose work it is and who gave it to us.\" Chris Cutler Recorded USA 1984.

Nothing could be said to be a typical Sun Ra show, yet this does cover the range you could probably expect to hear had you attended one of his big-band gigs at the time. \"Fate in a Pleasant Mood\" is a joy, a jovial, hummable, swinging number with playful synthesizer swoops and faint vocal scats. Nothing else on the disc is nearly as accessible, as the synthesizer soon takes over proceedings with a Frankensteinian vengeance; the title track, in fact, is something that Hollywood horror film producers would probably reject as too creepy. Don't wait expectantly for the out-there synth jams to end and the band to return to more ingratiating tunes; the CD is only 31 minutes long."}, {"allmusic_rating": 0, "recording_dates": [1984], "author": "Le Sun Ra and his Cosmo Discipline Arkestra", "review_by": "", "notes": "Leo's 1995 edition on cd contains material from this recording as well as other material coming from a concert in NYC in 1988 or 1990.", "recording_locations": ["France"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/A Night in East Berlin.jpg", "allmusic_url": "", "more_text": "112.

Live concert, probably in France, 1985. I'll Never Be the Same is not listed on the label. [rlc] I was involved with Leo in one of the releases of A Night in East Berlin: working out what was on some of the tapes which had become entangled with the various issues, and writing liner notes. Originally A Night in East Berlin was a Saturn cassette, sold at gigs by the Arkestra. In the late 1980s Leo Records did a deal with Sun Ra, and released it as an LP, somewhat re-edited, but without additional material. When it became time for a CD issue, Leo for chose to add as a filler part of another Sun Ra tape they had purchased earlier. Later still, Leo decided that this other tape would make a good release in its own right, and issued it complete as A Quiet Place in the Universe: it is a recording from around 1977, an unedited section of a concert performance which includes two Sun Ra compositions not available anywhere else on CD or LP. This release of A Quiet Place meant that Leo at that point had a Sun Ra CD on the market which partially duplicated the East Berlin CD. Their response to this was to issue a different A Night in East Berlin on CD, keeping the same catalogue number as the old one(!), but replacing the music from the A Quiet Place session with another filler titled My Brothers the Wind & Sun No 9. This new filler had, for some strange reason, been sold to Leo as \"recorded in Europe in 1990\", but it turned out really to come from one of the Hidden Fire Saturn LPs, recorded in New York in 1988 \u2014 the very last Saturn releases. So there exist one Saturn and three Leo editions of A Night in East Berlin, all of which differ from each other in some way! That's not quite the end of the story, however: the concert was also broadcast, unedited, on East German TV in 1988, as two 45 minute shows. It would make a superb video release \u2014 the music really gains extra impact in that format \u2014 but sadly, I'm not aware that anyone has plans for a video issue of it. \u2014Chris Trent 112A.Sun Ra and his Cosmo Discipline Arkestra A Night In East Berlin / My brothers the wind & sun n.9 Leo CD LR 149 (1995; CD) Mystic Prophecy [Sun Ra] (10:11) Beyond the Wilderness of Shadows [Sun Ra] (2:22) Prelude to a Kiss [Duke Ellington] (2:58) Space Is the Place [Sun Ra] / We Travel the Spaceways [Sun Ra] (3:28) Interstellar Low Ways [Sun Ra] (8:24) The Shadow World [Sun Ra] (9:04) Rocket Number Nine [Sun Ra] (1:44) Tyrone Hill-tb; Pat Patrick-as; Marshall Allen-as, fl; John Gilmore-ts, perc, voc; Danny Ray Thompson-bs, bgo; Eloe Omoe-as, bcl; James Jacson-bsn, Ancient Egyptian Infinity Drum; Sun Ra-p, org, syn, voc; Bruce Wdwards-eb; Buster Smith-d.

Although Ra's usual band members of the period appear on most of the cuts (including singer June Tyson, trumpeter Michael Ray, altoist Marshall Allen and tenor saxophonist John Gilmore), this CD also has many musicians one would not expect in this setting during 1988-89: drummer Billy Higgins, trombonist Julian Priester, Don Cherry on pocket trumpet, altoist James Spaulding and (briefly out of retirement) trumpeter Tommy Turrentine. The ensembles perform some typically eccentric Ra compositions, including \"Stardust for Tomorrow,\" \"Love In Outer Space\" and \"Hole In the Sky,\" in bands ranging from four (the unusual quartet of Cherry, Spaulding, Ra and singer Tyson) to 22 pieces. Due to the variety and very interesting personnel, plus many examples of the keyboardist/leader stretching himself, this somewhat obscure effort is easily recommended to Sun Ra collectors.", "title": "Somewhere Else", "lineup": "See each track individually.", "release_date": 1993}, {"allmusic_rating": "9", "recording_dates": [1988], "author": "Sun Ra", "review_by": "Sean Westergaard", "notes": "There is an LP edition on which Nashira was moved to the fourth place, at the end of side A.", "recording_locations": ["New York"], "cover": "/img/sunra_covers/Blue Delight.jpg", "allmusic_url": "http://www.allmusic.com/album/blue-delight-mw0000204451", "more_text": "120.

Both Michael Ray and Marshall Allen are in fine form on this date, with Allen shining especially bright on \"Prelude to a Kiss.\" (He always tears it up on the Ellington numbers.) Unfortunately, due to ill health, John Gilmore is absent from this recording, gearing it more toward the completist/collector than the casual listener. Sound quality is good, but there are some problems associated with a live date: some minor swells of feedback on stage during \"Blue Lou\" and some slightly off-mike moments. The performance, though, is a fine one.

At its worst (the 19-minute \"Of Invisible Theme\"), the ensemble rambles on aimlessly, almost as if were creating a sound effects record. Unfortunately their versions of \"Love in Outer Space\" and \"Stars Fell Oon Alabama\" are quite silly with the former featuring a \"glee club\" vocal while the latter displays Ra's lack of a singing voice. Another minus is the sudden mood change during an otherwise lyrical piano-bass duet on \"Journey Towards the Stars\" caused by a surprise entrance from Marshall Allen's out-of-tune alto. Cornetist Don Cherry (always muted), James Spaulding on flute and alto, John Gilmore on tenor and trombonist Julian Priester get some solo space but most impressive is John Ore's busy and versatile bass playing and Ra's frequently Monk-ish piano.

He led a sextet with Chris Anderson on piano, John Gilmore's rugged, soaring tenor sax taking the featured soloist role, and bassist John Ore and Buster Smith completing the rhythm section. Bruce Edwards provided guitar fills and accompaniment, while Ra offered synthesizer coloration, textures, and swirling support. Ra's lines seem to flag a bit on the opening cut, \"'Round Midnight,\" but he's worked out the kinks by the second number, \"Sun Ra Blues,\" and for the remainder of the session adds looping countermelodies and phrases to Anderson's themes and statements.", "title": "At the Village Vanguard", "lineup": "John Gilmore-ts, voc; Ra-syn; Chris Anderson-p; John Ore-b; Earl C. \"Buster\" Smith-d; Bruce Edwards, eg.

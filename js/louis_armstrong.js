This pair of tracks that would seem, on first listening, as a slip backward for Satch. But, on further examination, these sides are thoroughly charming, positivelysopping with a 1920's aesthetic created by Ellis' nasal tenor. And -- what's this?!? -- one glance at the sidemen affirms an additional importance to this session that is at once disposable and timeless. Not only that, but ithas to be noted that Seger Ellis was OKeh's top-selling male vocalist of the era, a man who constantly surrounded himself with some of the top jazzmen -- black and white -- of the time. He is absolutely forgotten now, but these 1929 sides are really the equivalent of a duet between Frank Sinatra and Willie Nelson: memorable if for nothing else but their eccentric unlikelihood.", "location": "New York, NY", "lineup": "Ellis, Seger (Vocal) Armstrong, Louis (Trumpet) Dorsey, Tommy (Trombone) Dorsey, Jimmy (Clarinet) Hoffman, Harry (Violin) Ring, Justin (Piano, Celeste) King, Stan (Drums)", "songs": "<p><b>S'posin'</b> (Razaf, Andy; Denniker, P.)

When the second (CK 64925) was produced ten years later, a pristine copy of the first LP pressing was digitally mastered, and second generation tapes -- edited in the 1950's for EP issues -- were spliced in when available. The second release is the more definitive of the two.

<p>Back in October 2012, in <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/bobby-
mcferrin_12.html">my post about Bobby
McFerrin</a> I mentioned I attended a concert in New York, but never
talked more about it, so I wanted to do that now.<br />
Last September I went on a trip through New York, Washington and my beloved
New Orleans (you can check out the photos on <a href="http://zanderle.com/">my
website</a>). As was my wish for years, I wanted to see
where jazz was born. Just days before my departure to New York, I found that
Wynton Marsalis and JALC were performing with Bobby McFerrin. I had to double
check, because I could not believe my eyes. I was ecstatic. Two of my
favourite artists performing together?! What a way to start the trip that was
already meant to be all about music anyway.<br />
The venue - Lincoln Center in The Time Warner Center on the 60th street - was
so beautiful, sophisticated and classy. Some don’t care about that, but I
always appreciate a nice atmosphere at a concert. The concert’s theme was
Bobby McFerrin’s biography, but I felt that wasn’t exactly the main thing of
the night, it was more of a way to convey this great collaboration. I
mentioned Jazz at Lincoln Center in one of <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/eric-clapton-wynton-
marsalis-play-blues.html">my previous
posts</a> and they are truly amazing. It’s a band consisting
of only great musicians and I really enjoy their sound and like pretty much
anything they do. At the concert it felt like they could make anyone sound
awesome, let alone Bobby McFerrin. I am a great admirer of both Bobby McFerrin
and Wynton Marsalis, and this was probably one of the best concerts I’ve ever
been to. In hindsight I would, however, like to see Bobby do more of his usual
crazy stuff and Wynton solo more. But nevertheless, the concert was magical
just the way it was. The band and Bobby just clicked on so many levels and I
guess that’s the result of Bobby blending in more and not doing his usual
stuff to the fullest potential.<br />
I was so thankful to be able to listen to their rich sound in person. It was
so intense, I remember getting emotional and filled with such happiness
throughout the concert. Ah, I can’t wait the next time I’m going to hear
Wynton or Bobby live again.<br />
I highly recommend you listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcByeRvkBQ0">the whole
concert</a>, I believe it’s well
worth it. But if you don’t have the time, or are not interested, here are a
few excerpts.  </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=24m40s">Beautiful rendition</a> of George
Gershwin’s Prelude No. 2. It’s evident right away, how well they they go
together, Bobby and JALC.  </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=52m30s">Charlie Parker’s Donna Lee</a>, and the
only time at the concert where Wynton and Bobby directly interact with each
other. And it is golden! If you’ll listen to only one song, listen to this
one. Their duet always brings a smile on my face, it’s just soo good!!! I love
it.  </p>

<p>They performed this concerts a couple of nights in a row. I was there on the
opening night and the video on youtube is from one of the following nights.
There are minor differences, but there is also one major one. On the opening
night, there was Paul Simon in the audience and after the intermission, Mr
McFerrin called him up on stage to sing Scarborough Fair with him. At first he
was really reluctant and didn’t want to come up, and we all really thought he
wouldn’t. But after a lot of convincing from the audience, Paul came up.
That’s right. Paul freakin’ Simon! Just when I thought the night can’t get any
better… Needless to say, it was the highlight of the concert. Beautiful,
magical, mysterious and heartwarming.<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=1h50s">Here is</a> a version without Paul,
beautiful as well.  </p>

<p>And finally some crazy Bobby McFerrin stuff -
<a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=1h20m50s">here</a> he sings Beethoven’s 7th
Symphony. I know right, who on earth sings this?<br />
At the concert I attended, Bobby sang solo a capella version of Somewhere Over
the Rainbow for encore. Genius!<br />
I’ll say it again, I strongly recommend you take an hour and forty minutes for
yourself and enjoy this beautiful performance. I think Bobby McFerrin and
Wynton Marsalis have some special energy between them and you can hear it
firsthand.<br />
It’s actually one of my wishes, that they record an album together. They’re
just so amazing together. Listen to a song they recorded together on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CNQNU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0001CNQNU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">one of Wynton’s albums</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0001CNQNU" alt="" /> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLD8i8CMw14">Baby, I Love You</a>. The kind of chemistry they
have is simply infectious.  </p>

<p>What about you, what do you think? Thoughts on the concert, Bobby, Wynton,
JALC, the post? As I always, I encourage you to share your comments.  </p>

<p>Until next time everyone.</p>

<p>For some reason, I’m really afraid of writing about instrumental music. Even
though I really want to, basically all my posts so far have been about music
that includes a singer. After confiding in <a href="http://mitrovic.co/blog/">my
friend</a> about this fear, he made a great suggestion:
we would tell each other which instrumental album to write about on our next
blog post, and just do it. It was exactly the kind of motivation I needed. So
here I am, nervous and afraid, writing my very first post about a piece of
solely instrumental music.</p>

<p>The album my friend chose for me is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006GO9Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006GO9Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">In a Silent Way</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006GO9Q" alt="" /> by Miles Davis. I
usually talk about the artist for a little bit, but if I wanted to talk about
Miles, one whole post probably wouldn’t suffice, so I’ll make it extra brief.
Miles Davis, born in 1926, was a jazz trumpeter and one of the most
influential musicians in the 20th century. For 50 years, he basically kept
inventing new genres and explored jazz in so many new directions (Bebop, Hard
bop, Modal jazz, Fusion, Cool jazz). It’s safe to say that jazz today wouldn’t
be where it is without him. If you don’t know who he is, you might want to
read something about him, as he is one of the most important figures of the
20th century music. Or better yet, listen to some of his classic albums -
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmaQdPoWVGM">Kind Of Blue</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sVapY6JDu8">‘Round About
Midnight</a> or
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38bShXrS7pM">Milestones</a>. Keep in mind though,
that that is only a tiny part of his musical career - what he’s created over
the years ranges far beyond these three albums.</p>

<p>When I first started listening to
jazz and heard about Miles Davis, I just didn’t get it why he’s supposed to be
so good. Sure, I liked Kind Of Blue, but that’s about it. It was making me
kind of annoyed, that everyone was praising him so much. I thought he was
overrated and was frustrated that no one else saw that. Even with this
opinion, I didn’t think his early stuff was bad or anything, whereas the weird
fusion thingy, I just couldn’t take. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7mHNEA7z2U">weird
appearance</a> on stage didn’t help
with that. So, very early on, I decided that I don’t really care for Miles
Davis and that I hate jazz fusion.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-B1a2Tm9SnFk2FUWctVDOlvKI2FAAAAAAAABTY2F-svjWC-iVoo2Fs16002Fmiles-davis-by-jan-persson.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Four years of listening to jazz (but avoiding Miles and anything similar)
later, I suddenly found myself getting more and more interested in Bebop,
Avant-Garde, Modern jazz, all the stuff I thought I didn’t like. Just like
that, Miles’ music eventually crept back to me after all that time. I gave the
albums I knew, another listen and was surprised that this was the same music
as the kind I used to dislike. It sounded differently. I loved it! There were
so many beautiful things happening in the music and I couldn’t understand how
I couldn’t hear that before. Even though I had evidence against me, I kept my
skepticism against Miles.</p>

<p>So when my friend asked me to write about Miles Davis’ album, you can imagine
how I was unsure about that. I thought to myself “how on earth am I going to
write about this?? I’m probably not even going to like it”. Nevertheless, I
decided that, for once in my life, I’ll get out of my own way, and agreed on
the choice. It turns out, I LOVE the album! It’s one of the most intriguing
things I’ve ever heard. As if that wasn’t enough of a surprise, I found out
that In A Silent Way is supposed to be the first fusion album Miles recorded.
. . I was confused, “Wait, aren’t I suppose to hate fusion jazz? But this
sounds so good. How come?”. After a few seconds of thinking about it, the
music took over and it didn’t matter anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmQwzAsOw1k">The album</a> itself is wonderful!
It’s dreamy, contemplative, other-worldly, melancholic, magical and even dark.
I don’t know if I’ve mentioned this before, but I’ve always been fascinated by
dreams and everything related to them. So it’s probably just me, but I feel
like this whole album is about dreams, which is why I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>The first song, Shhh/Peaceful, starts off with just the drums, organ, piano,
bass and guitar letting you look around and get the feeling of what the song
is going to look like. They set the stage for Miles, and when he comes in, he
glides on top of that background, as smooth as ever. Listen to his tone and
articulation. He’s got such control over his instrument, it sounds like it’s
not just a trumpet, but an extension of his thoughts.</p>

<p>The song then goes on and develops like dreams do. And you know how in dreams
something’s always off and even though you’re somehow aware of it, everything
feels just right anyway. Well, listen how the drums provide a really groovy
and quite powerful beat, but the music itself is so mellow and gentle. At
first it sounds a bit off, but after awhile it just feels right.</p>

<p>Another correlation between this song and dreams is how many details the sound
has. No matter where you look, there’s always a detail you didn’t hear before.</p>

<p>The song continues making an impression like that until, just after becoming
slightly turbulent, it rolls off.</p>

<p>At this point, I was already totally in awe, but there was another part, just
as good as the first one. What a treat!</p>

<p>The second song, In a Silent Way/It’s About That Time, begins so darn
beautifully! It sounds so optimistic and hopeful, something like a beautiful
landscape after a storm. After you get a chance to really hear this gorgeous
sound, the flow changes quite abruptly and they start building on top of that.
It feels like this beautiful music is delicate and sensitive, since after a
slight change, everything follows. I guess it sounds like, what I think a
development of an idea in someone’s mind would sound like - from that first
inkling to a full-blown idea. In any case, an amazing second part to this
unbelievable album.</p>

<p>Listening to and thinking about this album was a really wonderful experience.
I sat in a cozy chair, dimmed the lights and set the music to a comfortable
volume. Then I listened. . . I mean really listened. I was shocked by how many
things I could actually hear. If I had listened to this about a year ago, I
would have thought it’s nonsense. I guess I must have had some kind of
invisible earplugs in my ears.</p>

<p>Forty minutes of this dreamy music went by like four minutes. The whole album
is filled with so many thoughts, feelings and emotions, I found myself
thinking about it for some time after it stopped playing. And I love how great
music inspires me to listen to even more music, which is exactly what happened
in the next few days.</p>

<p>I suggest you give In a Silent Way a listen as well. Don’t think about it too
much, just listen and let yourself feel the wonders of music.</p>

    <p><img src="/img/2Fwp-content2Fuploads2F20112F042FBen-Harper-There-will-be-a-light.jpeg" alt="" />
Two months ago I began making some decisions about my
studies and consequently I was focusing on college and neglected my blog and
photography. I’ve simply put it on hold. I thought I didn’t miss it that much,
but then, a couple of days ago, I was reading one of my older posts. It made
me remember why I started writing in the first place. I mean I enjoy just
listening to music, but writing about it gives me something more. It makes me
more aware of how passionate I actually am about music and I love that
feeling. So here I am again, writing after a (too) long break. For the past
few weeks I’ve also started doing something new - I committed to listening 2
new albums every week, which means I definitely won’t run out of stuff to
write about.</p>

<p>Enough about that, let me talk about what I’m here to talk about. In 2004 Ben
Harper and the Blind Boys of Alabama recorded an album called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDIE7Y/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDIE7Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">There Will Be A Light</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000TDIE7Y" alt="" />. It is one of my
favourite albums of all time and one of the best collaboration albums I know.
I’ve always been completely blown away by good collaborations. It’s simply
beyond me how two groups are able to melt into one so completely so that they
don’t sound like two separate groups, while at the same time, retain and show
what each makes them unique. And it all fits together perfectly! It’s nothing
short of magical. The reason I’m bringing this up is because the way Ben
Harper and the Blind Boys Of Alabama work together on these 11 songs is an
epitome of what I’m trying to say.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fserve2F_2F297629192FBen2BHarper2BAnd2BThe2BBlind2BBoys2BOf2BAlabama.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before I listened to this album, I knew Ben Harper’s music as quite eclectic,
but the part I was interested in was a mixture of indie, rock, folk and maybe
blues, with most of his songs being introspective and somewhat melancholic.
Which I love. Here are a few great songs, so you can hear what I mean.</p>

<p>The Blind Boys of Alabama is a gospel
group that’s been active for well over 70 years now and they’re one of the
best in their field. And if you’re wondering, yes, they’re actually blind
(apart from one member I believe). They were performing in Ljubljana a couple
of years ago and I really regret not seeing them - at that time I had no idea
who they are. Now I can’t think of any other group that would make this album
as powerful as it is now.</p>

<p>Seven of the songs on the album are written by Ben, specifically for this
occasion. The rest are traditional gospel tunes and covers (keep an eye on Bob
Dylan’s Well, Well, Well). The moment I heard the first song of the album,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FALuWDPOLdg">Take My Hand</a>, I knew I was in
for a treat. What an understatement that proved to be. The album is just that
good!</p>

<p>The Blind Boys of Alabama create a basis on which Ben flourishes. They provide
a background that’s rich, joyful and full of faith to his emotional, honest
and heartwarming singing. Add to that a great instrumental accompaniment and
you get this incredible piece of music. Here are, in my opinion, the
highlights of the album:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fimages2Fstories2Fmarch20032Fapril20102Fmay20102Fjune20102Fblind2520boys2520of2520alabama252001.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The title song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-lHWmpVxzk">There Will Be a
Light</a>. No words needed here. Just
listen and feel it.</p>

<p>Powerful rendition of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPn8ivGUVG0">Well, Well,
Well</a> with some crazy guitar work
on 11th commandment before that.</p>

<p>The a cappella song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca1vnGfIWVo">If I Could Hear My Mother Pray
Again</a>, is simply haunting. It’s
amazing that a human voice without any instruments to back it up is capable of
creating such an emotional work of art. Probably my favourite song of the
album - the Blind Boys Of Alabama at their best, if you ask me.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you love it as much as I do? Do you agree that their
collaboration on this album is perfect?</p>

<p>Until next time…</p>

<p>P.S. Does anyone have any requests for what you would like to see me write
about next time?</p>

<p>Next up in this women in jazz series is the magnificent Ella Fitzgerald. I
feel a bit intimidated writing about her - she was just that good! Her voice
is probably as pure as it gets. It’s bright, perfectly clear and it’s very
comforting. Her singing is so effortless that she makes it seem like it’s easy
to sing like that. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to have Ella for
a grandma. Whenever someone felt blue, she would just sing their troubles
away. While I love <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a> and <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, they never make me feel as good as Ella always does. It’s
easy to get caught up in her music and forget about your worries.  </p>

<p>I got to know Ella through my love of Louis Armstrong. As you may know, Lady
Ella and Satchmo recorded 3 albums together, all of which are simply golden.
Some people refer to ‘Porgy and Bess’ album as “Sandpaper and whipped cream”.
I personally prefer the first two albums - ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RD5E/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00004RD5E">Ella &amp; Louis</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00004RD5E" alt="" />’
and ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084H9J/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000084H9J">Ella andLouis Again</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000084H9J" alt="" />’
. A combination of her singing and her exquisite voice, his amazing trumpet playing and his raspy
voice is entrancing. Listen to ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmoiGZuiFQ">They Can’t Take That Away From
Me</a>’ or ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtG9CnMtzZk">Learning The
Blues</a>’ to get a feeling of what
I’m talking about. And even if you’re not interested in what I’m talking
about, just listen to the songs because it’s wonderful music and also because
these albums are probably an example of one of the best collaborations ever.<br />
For some other Ella Fitzgerald’s albums, I would recommend ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000479L/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000479L">Intimate Ella</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00000479L" alt="" />’ or

Ellington’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001LOYS8Y" alt="" />. The first two are
actually not even that jazzy, so they might be especially appropriate for
someone who’s not that into jazz, but because of Ella’s amazing vocals they
will also be liked by jazz fans. ‘Intimate Ella’ is a good one to get the most
out of her voice, since she’s accompanied only by a piano on this one. Here’s
an example.  </p>

<p>I read about her life the other day and I was quite surprised. Ella was born
and brought up in poverty and she was actually homeless for a year before
starting her career. She hit her big break at a talent show in Harlem. She was
supposed to dance, but after seeing an amazing dance act go on before her, she
got scared and at the last second decided to sing instead. Best last second
decision ever!<br />
Behind the stage, she was actually shy and reserved, which I think no one
would guess because she looked so confident and, in her own words, felt at
home on the stage. Singing is what she lived for. She often felt self-
conscious about her looks and at times even doubted her abilities. How can
someone so talented doubt themselves?! I guess she was still only a human,
like the rest of us, even though she sounded otherworldly.  </p>

<p>What is your favourite Ella Fitzgerald album or song? Your thoughts are
appreciated.</p>

<p>I had something different in mind for today’s post, but something happened
that is just too important not to write about. An American piano legend, Dave
Brubeck, passed away today. He would turn 92 tomorrow. He was known for his
unusual time signatures and poly-rhythms. During his 60 year career, he toured
with names like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker and Dizzy
Gillespie. He was featured on Time magazine’s cover - at the time, the second
jazz musician ever to be featured on its cover, with only Louis Armstrong
preceding him.<br />
Most people will know him through songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs">Take
Five</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc34Uj8wlmE">Blue Rondo A La
Turk</a>. Maybe you don’t even know
you know him, but most likely you’ve heard these songs before.<br />
I think he’s very easy to listen to, but he also has so much to offer. I
recommend him to anyone, to long time jazz lovers as well as to people who are
just getting into jazz. He wasn’t being praised so much for nothing…  </p>

<p>His renown, in part, comes from his great album <a href="http://www.amazon.c
om/gp/product/B000002AGN/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode

, which is something you have to hear at least once in your life, but the reason I love Dave
Brubeck is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006O9MER8/
ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9

, a project with his wife Iola, created specifically with Louis Armstrong in mind. Regarding the
project much can be found in Ricky Riccardi’s
<a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and book <a href="htt
p://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307473295/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougon

. I won’t go into detail about it (I will come back about this as this is material
for a post on its own) but I will say it’s a masterpiece ahead of its time and
it’s one of my favourite Louis Armstrong’s albums.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtTL-Z5EyEY">Here’s</a> a song out of the album.
Iola wrote the lyrics and she meant them to be light and humorous, especially
the part  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They say I look like God.<br />
Could God be black? My God!<br />
If all are made in the image of thee,<br />
Could thou perchance a zebra be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was meant as a joke, but Louis sang them with such seriousness it brings the
song to a whole new level.<br />
Anyway, I’ll talk about the album some other time, I had to at least mention
it. If you want to listen to some great music and hear Louis Armstrong do
something atypical for him, give this album a listen. It’s well worth it!  </p>

<p>A musical legend left us today and left a great legacy. Do the right thing and
go enjoy some of it.  </p>

<p>Come back for more reading as I’ll do a Christmas special later this week!  </p>

<p>There are many reasons why I decided to do a Christmas Special. For one, I
LOVE Christmas. As a little kid, I used to count down days till Christmas and
my birthday (which is near Christmas) one month in advance. I don’t do that
anymore, but not much has changed since then. I’m still a little kid who gets
giddy with excitement over Christmas. I can easily get into the Christmas
spirit and I love it! For example a couple of days ago, the first snow of this
winter inspired me to put on Christmas music and prepare some roasted nuts and
mulled wine for my parents and my girlfriend, even though it was just the
beginning of December.<br />
And the reason I’m doing a Christmas special more than two weeks before
Christmas, is because I’m sure there are plenty more people like me out there.
Also, I want to give anyone interested in the albums I’ll be talking about
some time to get them (getting them on Christmas Eve is too late).  </p>

<p>I’ve been a fan of Christmas music for some time, but I was never able to find
something good. Most of what I listened to, was of bad quality, it all sounded
pretty much the same and it seemed like it was made in a hurry and with just
money in mind. I guess that’s the sad part of Christmas music - it’s easy and
cheap to make and everyone will try making it, which means there’s so much
crap out there. But fortunately there’s also a lot of great heartwarming
Christmas music, you just have to find it. Last year, as a combination of luck
and frustration, I found a couple of Christmas albums which I just love and
today, I wanted to share them with you. Hopefully you’ll enjoy them as much as
I do and they will bring you some Christmas cheer.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fimages2Fvince_guaraldi_trio3Aa_charlie_brown_christmas.jpeg" alt="" /><br />
The first one is my favourite Christmas album ever. Most of you will know it,
but whoever doesn’t, should listen to it as soon as possible. Vince Guaraldi
and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090X4H0
W/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative
=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0090X4H0W">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0090X4H0W" alt="" />.
It’s a perfect combination of holiday playfulness, jazz, warm sounds and of course -
Christmas spirit. It tastes exactly like those roasted nuts and mulled wine
did. It’s on top of my ‘most played albums during holidays’ list. Below is a
little taste of it. Now go and get it!  </p>

<p><img class="small right" src="/img/2Fwikipedia2Fen2F72F7b2FWynton_Marsalis_Christmas_Jazz_Jam.jpg" /></p>

<p>If we’re already at the more jazzy side of Christmas, I have to mention Wynton
Marsalis’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SROHI4/ref
=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325
&amp;creativeASIN=B002SROHI4">Christmas Jazz Jam</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002SROHI4" alt="" />. This one’s a bit
more demanding than A Charlie Brown Christmas, so it may not be to everyone’s
liking, but it’s a great album. It has many wonderful moments like Good King
Wenceslas and O Little Town Of Bethlehem to name just two. Whenever I listen
to this album I feel like it’s putting together two of my favourite things.
Jazz and Christmas. Does it get any better than jazzy Christmas?  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2F32FJPG_2502FMI00022F4542FMI0002454500.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Still on Christmas with jazz, here’s Louis Armstrong &amp; Friends doing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005KPO/ref=as_li_tf_
tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeA
SIN=B000005KPO">What a
Wonderful Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000005KPO" alt="" />. When I first heard
it, I was a bit disappointed to hear there are only 6 out of 14 songs by
Louis. This makes it more of a compilation with a focus on Satchmo than an
album done by him. Nevertheless it’s a wonderful album that’s easy to enjoy.
It features names like <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, Duke Ellington, Peggy Lee, Louis Jordan and Lena Horne. All
in all, it’s an even better combination than Christmas Jazz Jam - Jazz and
Christmas AND Louis Armstrong! Just thinking about it, makes me feel all warm
and fuzzy inside. The only thing that leaves you sad after listening to the
album is that Louis Armstrong didn’t record more Christmas songs, because he’s
so incredibly good at it. Here’s Winter Wonderland done by him. Listen and see
what I’m talking about.  </p>

<p>(<a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/2011/12/very-satchmo-christmas-2011-edition.html">Here’s</a> a post about it in Ricky Riccardi’s blog)  </p>

<p>That’s it for now but I’m not done yet. Next time I’ll continue with other
great, maybe a bit unexpected but great Christmas albums. Until then, tell me,
is there anyone else out there who gets excited over Christmas and Christmas
music? What are your favourites?</p>

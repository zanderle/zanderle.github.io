<p>It is not easy for me to write about Louis Armstrong. He has affected me profoundly and means so much to me I’m nervous my writing won’t do him justice. It’s pretty telling that all the time that I’ve had this blog I haven’t written about the single most important reason why I started listening to this music in the first place. But here it goes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If it hadn’t been for him, there wouldn’t have been none of us. I want to thank Mr. Louis Armstrong for my livelihood.” - Dizzy Gillespie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was talking to a Slovenian trumpeter the other day, and was surprised when he admitted that he never <em>really listened</em> to Louis Armstrong. A similar thing happened some days later listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOH_mioL3TU">When You’re Smiling</a> with another professional musician, when I found out she didn’t know the song. I’m not sure why, but for some reason I just assumed that everyone is very familiar with Louis Armstrong and his music. I mean he is the father of Jazz, right? He was and is my greatest inspiration and the one who opened doors to a whole new musical universe for me. Maybe that is why I thought others interested in (jazz) music would have at least slightly similar experience. Turns out I couldn’t be more wrong. More often than not people quickly dismiss Armstrong by falling to the old clichés of him either being outdated our not true to the music. Both of these are ridiculously far from the truth. Or they have simply never paid any attention to ol’ Satchmo. And that’s what pushed me to write this post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What we play is life” - Louis Armstrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to name two things that make Louis awe inspiring, I would probably say his music and who he was as a person - his liveliness, his spirit, his life story. Well, one could argue that it’s just one thing since the two are basically inseparable. There was no distinction for him. The music <em>was</em> his life.</p>

<h3 id="growing-up">Growing up</h3>

<blockquote class="block right image-right">	
"Louis was born poor, died rich, and never hurt anyone along the way" - Duke Ellington
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Louis Armstrong was born in 1901 in the famous birthplace of jazz, New Orleans. The city that lives and breathes music. The city that grabs any chance it can to celebrate and enjoy life. Where any event, big or small, happy or sad, is likely to be accompanied by music. New Orleans, this culturally rich environment, is an integral part of what makes Satchmo, Satchmo. All of it was imbued in him.<br />
I find it fascinating how often these passionate musicians ooze music in their everyday life. The way they talk, the way they walk is pure music (and I think that with musicians from New Orleans this is even more pronounced). And Louis Armstrong is a prime example - When you listen to him talk, or when you read his writings it’s all so musical. It’s like his life force was made out of music.<br />
His childhood was rough. Back O’ Town, the neighbourhood in which he grew up in, was so rough that it was aptly know as ‘The Battlefield’. And of course this was a time of segregation and racism.
Louis never finished school, but instead took different jobs supporting his mother so she wouldn’t have to turn to prostitution. Among many jobs this would include carrying coal to Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans. This exposed him to all the different facets of life, the people and the culture. It is where he got to hear a lot of music and he was soaking it all in. At this time, before learning to play the trumpet, he would sing in a quartet for money in the streets of New Orleans. He would also work for a Jewish family, the Karnofskys, who would make sure that he would never finish a day without getting a warm meal, as they knew that he was poor. They treated him like family. He never forgot this and wore a Star of David for the rest of his life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I ran into Louis on the street and I asked him home for dinner, I wanted him and the quartet to come around so my family could hear them sing. Well, Louis, he sort of hemmed around, and said he couldn’t make it. I could see there was something troubling him and finally he let it out. ‘Look, Sidney,’ he says, ‘I don’t have any shoes… these I got, they won’t get me there.’ Well I said that was easy fixed and gave him fifty cents to get his shoes repaired, and he went off promising me he would come.” - Sidney Bechet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then something kind of crazy happened. On a New Year’s eve he would steal his stepfather’s gun, and to celebrate he shot some blanks into the sky. He and his friends got a kick out of it. The police did not. They arrested him and he was sent to a Colored Waifs home for boys. And why is that crazy? Well, this is where he learned to play the cornet (and eventually, he would transition to the trumpet). Even at this age it was obvious that music was the love of his life. He was thrilled that he could play the cornet. After he was let go from the Home, between the different jobs he had, he would use every single chance he got to play his dear cornet. As the time went by, he would start getting bigger and bigger reputation around New Orleans.
Eventually (and I’m skipping a lot of chapters here) he moved to Chicago to play with his mentor, Joe King Oliver, whom he deeply respected and cherished all his life. And this is when his career started to kick of. This is where the history creating moment would happen - The Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings. After that, nothing in the world of music would ever be the same again.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p><img src="/img/louis-armstrong3.jpg" alt="Louis Armstrong" class="left image-left medium" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He’s the father of us all, regardless of style or how modern we get. His influence is inescapable. Some of the things he was doing in the 20’s and 30’s, people still haven’t dealt with.” - Nicholas Payton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Armstrong at that time was already doing all the revolutionary things in music, but Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings would capture it forever. It’s hard to overstate the value of these recordings. They were groundbreaking, and on them Armstrong basically defined what jazz would be from that moment on. He set the stage for the soloist in what was before mostly ensemble music. His endlessly inventive musical ideas would influence generations to come. And as if that wasn’t enough he would sing with equal revolutionary force as he played the trumpet. It’s also been said he invented scat singing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[Louis Armstrong] completely remade the sensibility of the culture. He remade the sensibility of the culture just as much as the Wright brothers did. See before the Wright brothers, people didn’t dream of being fliers. Ever. But after Kitty Hawk, you could dream that. And see, Armstrong changed the nature of dreaming. He made people dream things they have never dreamed before.” - Stanley Crouch (paraphrased)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So all in all he created a whole new musical dictionary. I mean he was like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein of music. I am astounded by these men - how can their ideas be so completely unlike anything that has come before them? How can they be so in tune with the universe, the world, or the music to create something so novel?<br />
You have probably heard of <em>6 degrees of separation</em> theory. Well, it’s been said that everyone in jazz is connected to (influenced by) Louis Armstrong through just 3 connections or less.</p>

<blockquote class="block right image-right">
"You know you can't play anything on a horn that Louis hasn't played." - Miles Davis
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest, these early Armstrong recordings (not just Hot Five and Hot Seven) stay as exceptional today as when they first came out. One might dismiss them as outdated because of the scratchy sound and not always perfect ensembles. But what Louis did in these recordings would be considered remarkable anytime, including today. Anyone who thinks differently should give it another listen. Beside seeing Armstrong as outdated, another very common complaint against him is that in his later years he supposedly ‘sold out’. I don’t want to get into that right now, but I will mention a <strong>great</strong> book about the subject, which throws all such statements out of the window. Ricky Riccardi’s <a href="http://amzn.to/11bHvxe">What a Wonderful World - The Magic of Louis Armstrong’s Later Years</a>. But these subjects of unjustified and lasting opinions call for a different blog post altogether anyway. So more on that another time.</p>

<p>I mentioned in <a href="/2014/07/02/How-I-got-into-jazz/">one of my previous posts</a> how I got into the music of Louis Armstrong. And at that time I had no idea about his importance. I was simply drawn to his music unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before. Music never made me feel this way before - Hell, forget music, I never felt this way before. I was hooked the moment I heard that sweet trumpet on ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IJzYAda1wA">La Vie En Rose</a>’. After that songs like ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPCBieSESI">West End Blues</a>’, ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udWB3OKV9_k">Potato Head Blues</a>’ would hold me in disbelief (and of course all this time I was oblivious to how historically groundbreaking these songs were). His whole body of work was so compelling and I have never heard anything that would even come close to this kind of intensity, that he basically opened a brand new world to me. An enormous musical world. A world which has become an important part of who I am and which I am still happily exploring. Plus he inspired me to take up the trumpet!</p>

<p>What happened to me when encountering his music for the first time was neither a chance nor was I the only one to experience that. It’s simply what’s in his music. It’s so timeless, full of life and vigor. And if you’re open to it, it will astound and enchant you. For me it opened a new cosmos. Not only did it make me see and appreciate music on new levels, but it also made me conscious of new aspects about myself. And that’s a huge thing to achieve all by itself let alone for a piece of music.
When talking about the intensity and vigor of his music, the same song always comes to mind. Whenever I hear this song I’m taken aback. At first I thought it’s just a personal preference, but after hearing the following quote (from a tuba player at that session), I realized it’s no coincidence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In that moment, he turned that place into a personal chapel. He looked up and he started talking to God… Nobody in the room but Louie and his God. It was absolutely frightening. And we got done with the first take, I’m standing there crying. I turned and looked, the drummer’s crying, the clarinet player’s crying, the trombones are crying, Lucille’s crying, his own wife.” - Rich Matteson</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="font-small">
You can hear the whole talk <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNKlmRPPGNs">here</a>. It’s beautiful.
</span></p>

<p>I find it fascinating what Louis does with this song. He doesn’t need any fast, intricate playing in order to get his message across. I’ve listened to a lot of music but I have never heard anyone else being able to put so much energy and intensity into a single note, the way Pops does. And you clearly hear it in this song. Here it is:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>
<p><br />
<img src="/img/louis-armstrong1.jpg" alt="Louis Armstrong in Corona" class="right breathe" />
Besides his music it is also quite amazing hearing about who Pops was as a person. There are countless tales about his warmth, humbleness, and generosity of his spirit. To experience a piece of that firsthand I highly recommend visiting the Louis Armstrong House Museum in New York. This was the house he and his wife Lucille bought in 1943, and it is where he passed away. Seeing as how popular he was at the time he could have bought any house practically anywhere he damn pleased, but he was happy to call this little house in a working-class neighbourhood, his home. He didn’t need or want anything other than this humble abode. He loved the neighbourhood and the neighbourhood loved him. One neighbour said that she didn’t even know the extent of his renown, until after he passed away - he was just such a simple man.</p>

<p>Often when he got a bonus after a tour or a recording, he would take a stack of white envelopes, write names on them of people he thought would need the money and divided the bonus among them. He could easily spend $2000 this way. He didn’t sign or put any notes about who it’s from in the envelopes, just cash.</p>

<p>His view on money was very down to earth: “What’s money anyhow? You make it and you might eat a little better than the next cat. You might be able to buy a little better booze than some wino on the corner. But you get sick just like the next cat, and when you die you’re just as graveyard dead as he is. So what’s the difference between me and some cat that’s making it at the Salvation Army Lodge? All I got was a little better roll of the dice.” [1]</p>

<p>He was also very grateful to all of his fans and to anyone who came to see his show. He would always make sure that the people who came to see his show would get their money’s worth. For example, the first time he came to Ljubljana, he was supposed to perform at 8 pm, but because of the weather he was terribly late. He and his band would arrive at the stage no earlier than 1:30 am! Because everyone had to wait for so long, he was dedicated to put up an even greater show than usual. Fans were not disappointed. [2]</p>

<p>And as always he would go backstage and wait for anyone wanting an autograph. He would always be the last member of the band to leave, making sure no one would leave empty handed. He was just so grateful to all of his fans. And these things weren’t a chore to him, he wanted to do it. Now compare that to the pop musicians of today.<br />
And another thing to understand is how popular he actually was at this time. One story always comes to mind - one time he stopped the war for a day; when he was doing a tour in Africa he also performed in Congo, where a civil war was raging. But for the day of his concert both sides called a day-long truce so everyone could go see the great Louis Armstrong. Enemies otherwise, would sit together on this special occasion.</p>

<h3 id="legacy">Legacy</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The genius of Louis Armstrong, the jazz-loving movie star Tallulah Bankhead wrote in 1952, “reaches across land frontiers and oceans. I believe in one world. I don’t use the term politically. I am thinking of the oneness of humanity. Louis is the epitome of one world.” [3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could keep talking about Louis Armstrong. I’ve just written the longest post on my blog and I feel I’ve barely scratched the surface. And such is his legacy as well. You can listen and relisten a hundred times, but the music will still find a way to move you in new and unexpected ways.<br />
Pops touched millions of souls, and inspired countless musicians. It’s really hard to describe what his impact was, as it is just so damn extensive and universal.<br />
I’ve often said that Louis Armstrong is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I know it probably sounds crazy, but I mean it.</p>

<p>Before I finish this, I just wanted to give a shout out to Ricky Riccardi, whose <a href="http://amzn.to/11bHvxe">book</a>, <a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and endless passion have fuelled my own passion and obsession. Besides being the world’s greatest expert on Louis Armstrong, he is an inspiration and an epitome of Louis Armstrong’s impact on humanity. Meeting Ricky in person last year, while visiting the Armstrong Archives, was one of the highlights of my life. <br />
<span class="font-small">Go check out his blog. Seriously! I’ve spent way too much time on that thing. It’s a joy to read and it’s got some true gems. For example in one post he talks about what songs Louis Armstrong listened to, hours before he passed away. Chilling. Go check it out.</span></p>

<p>The magic that Satchmo brought to this world is infinite and lasting. It makes the world a brighter place. Thank you, Pops.<br />
For everything.</p>

<h5 id="note-this-is-an-old-post-from-my-previous-blog-i-will-write-another-post-on-dr-john-in-the-next-few-days">Note: This is an old post from my previous blog. I will write another post on Dr. John in the next few days.</h5>

<p>Dr. John is one of my favourite New Orleans artists. Born Mac Rebennack in 1940, he’s been in the music business since the 50’s, although he didn’t get widely known until 70’s. He does everything from jazz, blues, New Orleans R&amp;B, rock and boogie woogie and he has this amazing ability of doing all these different styles at once and creating something unique. Critics have sometimes complained that he’s too eclectic but I say he’s just being extremely versatile and that’s something I appreciate about him. I also enjoy how no matter what he does, you can always hear New Orleans in him. He understands, respects and maintains the tradition of New Orleans.</p>

<p>He demonstrated what he’s musically capable of right away on his first album “Gris-Gris”. He somehow combined New Orleans R&amp;B and mystical voodoo into something extraordinary. The music on this album is a combination of eerie, earthy, mystical, spicy, joyous and complex. I think there’s no point in trying to describe what it’s like because it’s probably unlike anything you’ve heard before. But in a good sense. I definitely recommend it. It’s Dr. John’s album that got the most plaudits from the critics. If you’re interested, here’s an example of what you might expect - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n3CShvEWWs">Mama Roux</a>. After “Gris-Gris” he’s been just all over the place with different styles of music and he can offer so much with whatever he does.</p>

<p>Today I wanted to mention a song from one of his latest albums “The City that Care Forgot”. The song is called “You might be surprised” and the lyrics just blow me away every time I hear the song. Pay attention to them when you listen to the song. 
Dr. John has a distinct voice and a specific way of singing which has so much character and that’s what makes the song even better. Add some wonderful piano playing and you’ve got yourself a great song. Here it is.</p>

<p><span class="font-small">(This is not the album version, but I like this one is a lot better. It’s just way more intimate with only the piano and his amazing vocals)</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is a near death experience<br />
Hell is right here on this great big Earth<br />
It could be a little taste of heaven<br />
If we only knew our worth<br />
All we got to do is want it bad enough<br />
To push ourself through<br />
We always underestimate ourselves<br />
We do a little bit each and every day we can always do better<br />
In each and every way<br />
If we don’t believe in ourselves<br />
Nobody’s gonna do it<br />
If we don’t push ourselves<br />
We’ll never make it through it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What did you think?
I think the song is amazing and I LOVE the lyrics! It’s fascinating how the song starts off as a bit depressing and ends up being inspiring and optimistic.
Life is a near death experience: I think that’s a great line all by itself but it also sets up the whole song. One day you’re here, the next you’re not. Life is basically just the things we do before we die and we’re the only ones that determine what that will be like. We can (and do a lot of times) make it hell on earth but what we’re often not aware of, is that if we just believed in ourselves and pushed ourselves we could make it a little taste of heaven. And if everyone did that, imagine all the things we could achieve.</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of Cecile before, you’re in for a treat. If you have, then you know what I’m talking about. Cecile McLorin Salvant is a young singer based in New York, born and raised in Miami, Florida. A lot of big things have been said about her and her music and I must say that none of it is an exaggeration. She deserves every bit of recognition she’s been getting. If anything, she should get more. You know how every now and then you stumble upon someone who completely blows you away? Well, for me that was Cecile. I started listening to her just as I was getting over a breakup, and boy did her music prove to be helpful and healing. And that’s what great music can do. Heal. Inspire. Excite.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H3dFTyJK0NQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What makes her so amazing? Well, where to begin with someone so accomplished. Her voice is clear, rich and full. She has impeccable control and makes it look easy. She is not afraid to use her full range and when she sings, she’s not afraid to take chances. She’s a great storyteller. She sings with Ella’s clarity and eloquence, with Sarah’s expressiveness and dynamics and with Billie’s emotion and depth. She often talks about a long list of musicians that influenced her, and you can hear them all through her (for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbPDIgpHfU0">Bessie Smith</a>) - she has a great sense of jazz history and tradition. I love her taste in songs and how she brings very obscure and rarely recorded songs of the 20th century back to life, with an almost theatrical delivery.<br />
What I personally enjoy and appreciate the most, beside her obvious technical proficiency, is how she makes the lyrics come alive and how she interprets them in a way that make the song completely fresh and relatable. And then there’s this amazing ability to deliver two seemingly contradicting experiences of the human condition together, and show that they’re actually just two sides of a coin. Comedy and tragedy. Determined, thought-out artistry and childlike playfulness. She combines that in her music unlike anything you’ve heard before. Someone else that comes to mind when I talk about this, is Thelonious Monk, who incidentally, was also a big influence on Cecile.<br />
You can listen to her whole body of work to hear the things I’m describing, but here are just two examples (and the song earlier, ‘Poor Butterfly’, is definitely a testament to this, as well).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpQ_pWev24w">I Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate</a></p>

<p>So much fun! She makes this song, that could easily sound completely out of date, come to life, and she’s not afraid to interpret it in her own way. In fact, this is reminiscent of Louis Armstrong who, given a song, would take it, find the very essence of it, and recreate it as something novel and magical. And yes, you guessed it, Pops was also a great influence on Cecile.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kxDdkphgwQ">Nobody</a></p>

<p><em>(Would you have guessed that this song is over 100 years old?)</em><br />
The performance itself is amazing, but I feel if you know the background of the song, it makes everything even more special. ‘Nobody’ was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjyIoWIZXtY">originally performed</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Williams">Bert Williams</a>, a very popular comedian of the early 20th century. He was one of the (if not the) first successful African-American entertainer. Although he was widely loved by audiences, it was a different time back then and he went through a hard life, to say the least. When performing he would wear black-face, and often, in order to perform, he would have to pretend he’s white. So here’s a successful, talented black man, pretending to be white, pretending to be black. Naturally this caused a great deal of pain for him. And that doesn’t even begin to describe it. I mean, it’s crazy. How do you even talk about something like that?<br />
The song ‘Nobody’ was extremely popular, which he would say was both blessing and a curse. A fellow performer described Williams as “the funniest man I ever saw – and the saddest man I ever knew.”. There’s just so much irony and tragedy in all of that, and Cecile captures it perfectly.</p>

<p>If you’re interested, you should check out her album <a href="http://amzn.to/YjTXKu">WomanChild</a>. She performs with a band of incredible musicians - Aaron Diehl on piano, Rodney Whitaker on bass, James Chirillo on guitar and Herlin Riley on drums.<br />
She was also in the studios again last month, so I think we can expect a new album soon. Can’t wait!</p>

<p>Before I finish, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beWTOCmu1Z0">this hauntingly beautiful rendition of ‘There’s a Lull in My Life’</a> matched with a Prelude, done by Aaron Diehl (who deserves a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co4a4kb_J0Y">post of his own</a>). And don’t do what we usually do - don’t just put it on for the background music to whatever it is you are doing. As a matter of fact, try this (especially if you’re someone who thinks jazz music isn’t for them, or that you don’t get it). It will take only 5 minutes. Put away all distractions - phones, email notifications, anything like that. Don’t tweet, go on Facebook or check emails. Just put it all away for five minutes. Dim the lights, sit back and if you want, maybe even pour yourself a glass of wine. Then play the song. While you’re listening, relax and think about that special someone in your life. Might be your crush, might be the love of your life or the one that got away. Just sit back, take five minutes for yourself, and think about the love you feel for this person, while listening to this beautiful song.</p>

<p>Now tell me that didn’t strike a chord!</p>

<p><em class="ie-warning">This visualization might not work properly under your browser. Consider upgrading or getting a different browser.</em></p>

<p>[EDIT] Since I first posted this, I updated the visualization with some additional data from <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sun-ra-mn0000924232/discography">allmusic</a>.</p>

<p>With over 1000 recorded songs spanned over more than 100 albums, Sun Ra was one of the most prolific artists of the 20th century. I decided to make a simple visualization of this enormous body of work. I soon realized, this is no easy task. For one, the discography data is confusing to say the least. For a lot of albums, it is unclear who was in the band or where or when it was recorded. The band members themselves often gave conflicting reports regarding these things. I did my best with the data I could find in the <a href="http://www.the-temple.net/sunradisco/list.php">discography online</a>.<br />
After that confusion, I had to make a decision about which data to show. I eventually decided I am only going to visualize full-length albums (so excluding singles and records where Sun Ra appeared as guest).</p>

<p>So here it is - a simple timeline of Sun Ra’s recorded work. The albums are positioned on the timeline based on the year they were released (or if they have not been released - when they were recorded). The colors represent the whereabouts of recording sessions. If you hover over specific works, additional information will show up.
I might eventually expand it with some more features, but that’s it for now. I hope you like it :).</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

<p><span class="font-small">A few technical details, for those interested. I used <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> library for the actual visualization. To get the data from the website I mentioned earlier, I used <a href="http://import.io">import.io</a> (which was a joy to use, if I may add). And finally for parsing and cleaning up, Python was the way to go.</span></p>

<p>####”I think of myself as a complete mystery. To myself.” -Sun Ra</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCnls9CyKDI">Recommended listening while reading</a>)</p>

<p>One of my favorite places in the world are record stores. I love the atmosphere and the coziness they possess. To me, a record store is a magical, romantic place to be. It’s where serendipity happens daily. I appreciate the big ones as they are like sanctuaries of Music, but my heart lies with the small, charming record stores owned by lovers of Music. God knows they don’t earn a lot, but they can’t imagine doing anything else. I love how they put their heart and soul into the store and because of it, walking through it is actually so intimate. And that’s the beauty of it. Every record is there for a reason. Behind every item lies a story. Tragically though, record stores are dwindling. They’re being overthrown by internet sales and music departments in super-markets. So I make an effort to support these precious places. 
And that is how I came across Sun Ra (as well as many other gems). I first heard of him in <a href="http://www.jazzandbluesweb.com/">a record store in Ljubljana</a>. Then, when I was in New York I went to <a href="http://www.downtownmusicgallery.com/Main/index.htm">a very special record store in China Town</a> and after scouting for solid 30 minutes I asked the owner to tell me more about Sun Ra and maybe give me a recommendation. His eyes got brighter (this seems to be a common reaction when asking record store owners about Sun Ra). He went on to tell me bunch of stories about Sun Ra, where he saw him live, how he got hooked, then took me over to the CD’s, where he had a story for each one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In some far off place<br />
Many light years in space<br />
I’ll wait for you.<br />
Where human feet have never trod,<br />
Where human eyes have never seen.<br />
I’ll build a world of abstract dreams<br />
And wait for you.”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sun Ra</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s how I got started with Sun Ra. I didn’t immediately like him. However there’s a certain mysterious aura about him, that sooner or later draws you back whether or not you initially knew it will happen. So after being indifferent at first, I eventually found my way back, wanting to find out more and more about him and his music. I found the less I thought about what it all means, and the more I just let myself go and let the music take me wherever it may, the more I was enjoying it. I guess it’s not for everyone, but I find his music amazing.<br />
I’m astounded by the variety of forms that music can take, all the different meanings it can hold and all the different places it can take you. To me Sun Ra showed that beautifully. He was a bottomless well of artistry and creativity.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until last month, that his music really hit me(and inspired me to write this post). Sun Ra left our Earth in 1992, but his Arkestra continues to perform under Marshall Allen, who used to be in the original Arkestra. Last month, they came to Slovenia to a little town called Cerkno. Cerkno is renowned for hosting many jazz artist (through the festival, Jazz Cerkno). Going there for a concert in itself is an experience - an idyllic town snuggly put between the mountains, that during the festival lives for jazz. When I got there it seemed like the whole town woke up and proceeded to the main square where the concert was held. And the warm summer night with clear skies just added to the warm, homey feeling. Then just as the stars in the sky started to show up, so did the Arkestra - shiny and bright, one by one they came up on stage. Everyone was wearing a thought-out costume, that might consist of a shimmering cape and a hat for example. They were beautiful and otherworldly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The outer space beings are my brothers. They sent me here. They already know my music.”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sun Ra</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Then they began to play. Suddenly it all made sense - the music, the costumes, the philosophy, everything. It made perfect sense in that moment. I’m afraid I can’t describe it. It’s one of those things you have to experience for yourself, in person. The music showered upon me and I could feel there’s something big happening in front of me. It was a combination of this cosmic music and the whole stage moving and shimmering, everyone performing being in their own reveries, while at the same time where present to what they were playing. I sat there awe-struck. The music, the philosophy had a significant presence in the square. And the concert had it all - there were chaotic moments, as there were beautiful moments. It was complete, whole and perfect. The chanting in so many songs had a special quality too. There were moments when the band stepped down from stage and went through the audience, playing, singing, which was healing. It definitely was one of those concerts, when it’s done, something deep stays with you. My hour and a half drive back home through dark roads was something special. The music was with me.</p>

<p>This is definitely something that is well worth experiencing in person - and you might get a chance, the Sun Ra Arkestra is pretty active. Check out <a href="http://www.sunraarkestra.com/">their website</a> to see when they’ll be around and go check them out. If you don’t, you can still listen to the enormous treasure of music that Sun Ra left us. Here’s a <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-05-30/music/the-sun-ra-guide/">really cool guide</a> that might help.</p>

<p>This was a personal post - I might write another one that’s more about Sun Ra, especially if there will be some interest.</p>

<p>Anyway, leave a comment and let me know what you think.</p>

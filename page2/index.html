<p>Next up in this women in jazz series is the magnificent Ella Fitzgerald. I
feel a bit intimidated writing about her - she was just that good! Her voice
is probably as pure as it gets. It’s bright, perfectly clear and it’s very
comforting. Her singing is so effortless that she makes it seem like it’s easy
to sing like that. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to have Ella for
a grandma. Whenever someone felt blue, she would just sing their troubles
away. While I love <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a> and <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, they never make me feel as good as Ella always does. It’s
easy to get caught up in her music and forget about your worries.  </p>

<p>I got to know Ella through my love of Louis Armstrong. As you may know, Lady
Ella and Satchmo recorded 3 albums together, all of which are simply golden.
Some people refer to ‘Porgy and Bess’ album as “Sandpaper and whipped cream”.
I personally prefer the first two albums - ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RD5E/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00004RD5E">Ella &amp; Louis</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00004RD5E" alt="" />’
and ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084H9J/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000084H9J">Ella andLouis Again</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000084H9J" alt="" />’
. A combination of her singing and her exquisite voice, his amazing trumpet playing and his raspy
voice is entrancing. Listen to ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmoiGZuiFQ">They Can’t Take That Away From
Me</a>’ or ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtG9CnMtzZk">Learning The
Blues</a>’ to get a feeling of what
I’m talking about. And even if you’re not interested in what I’m talking
about, just listen to the songs because it’s wonderful music and also because
these albums are probably an example of one of the best collaborations ever.<br />
For some other Ella Fitzgerald’s albums, I would recommend ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000479L/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000479L">Intimate Ella</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00000479L" alt="" />’ or
some of her songbooks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKYZK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0034JKYZK">Cole Porter’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0034JKYZK" alt="" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000006P6L/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000006P6L">Gershwin’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000006P6L" alt="" /> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LOYS8Y/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001LOYS8Y">Duke 
Ellington’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001LOYS8Y" alt="" />. The first two are
actually not even that jazzy, so they might be especially appropriate for
someone who’s not that into jazz, but because of Ella’s amazing vocals they
will also be liked by jazz fans. ‘Intimate Ella’ is a good one to get the most
out of her voice, since she’s accompanied only by a piano on this one. Here’s
an example.  </p>

<p>I read about her life the other day and I was quite surprised. Ella was born
and brought up in poverty and she was actually homeless for a year before
starting her career. She hit her big break at a talent show in Harlem. She was
supposed to dance, but after seeing an amazing dance act go on before her, she
got scared and at the last second decided to sing instead. Best last second
decision ever!<br />
Behind the stage, she was actually shy and reserved, which I think no one
would guess because she looked so confident and, in her own words, felt at
home on the stage. Singing is what she lived for. She often felt self-
conscious about her looks and at times even doubted her abilities. How can
someone so talented doubt themselves?! I guess she was still only a human,
like the rest of us, even though she sounded otherworldly.  </p>

<p>What is your favourite Ella Fitzgerald album or song? Your thoughts are
appreciated.</p>

<p>I had something different in mind for today’s post, but something happened
that is just too important not to write about. An American piano legend, Dave
Brubeck, passed away today. He would turn 92 tomorrow. He was known for his
unusual time signatures and poly-rhythms. During his 60 year career, he toured
with names like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker and Dizzy
Gillespie. He was featured on Time magazine’s cover - at the time, the second
jazz musician ever to be featured on its cover, with only Louis Armstrong
preceding him.<br />
Most people will know him through songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs">Take
Five</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc34Uj8wlmE">Blue Rondo A La
Turk</a>. Maybe you don’t even know
you know him, but most likely you’ve heard these songs before.<br />
I think he’s very easy to listen to, but he also has so much to offer. I
recommend him to anyone, to long time jazz lovers as well as to people who are
just getting into jazz. He wasn’t being praised so much for nothing…  </p>

<p>His renown, in part, comes from his great album <a href="http://www.amazon.c
om/gp/product/B000002AGN/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode

, which is something you have to hear at least once in your life, but the reason I love Dave
Brubeck is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006O9MER8/
ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9

, a project with his wife Iola, created specifically with Louis Armstrong in mind. Regarding the
project much can be found in Ricky Riccardi’s
<a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and book <a href="htt
p://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307473295/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougon

. I won’t go into detail about it (I will come back about this as this is material
for a post on its own) but I will say it’s a masterpiece ahead of its time and
it’s one of my favourite Louis Armstrong’s albums.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtTL-Z5EyEY">Here’s</a> a song out of the album.
Iola wrote the lyrics and she meant them to be light and humorous, especially
the part  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They say I look like God.<br />
Could God be black? My God!<br />
If all are made in the image of thee,<br />
Could thou perchance a zebra be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was meant as a joke, but Louis sang them with such seriousness it brings the
song to a whole new level.<br />
Anyway, I’ll talk about the album some other time, I had to at least mention
it. If you want to listen to some great music and hear Louis Armstrong do
something atypical for him, give this album a listen. It’s well worth it!  </p>

<p>A musical legend left us today and left a great legacy. Do the right thing and
go enjoy some of it.  </p>

<p>Come back for more reading as I’ll do a Christmas special later this week!  </p>

<p>There are many reasons why I decided to do a Christmas Special. For one, I
LOVE Christmas. As a little kid, I used to count down days till Christmas and
my birthday (which is near Christmas) one month in advance. I don’t do that
anymore, but not much has changed since then. I’m still a little kid who gets
giddy with excitement over Christmas. I can easily get into the Christmas
spirit and I love it! For example a couple of days ago, the first snow of this
winter inspired me to put on Christmas music and prepare some roasted nuts and
mulled wine for my parents and my girlfriend, even though it was just the
beginning of December.<br />
And the reason I’m doing a Christmas special more than two weeks before
Christmas, is because I’m sure there are plenty more people like me out there.
Also, I want to give anyone interested in the albums I’ll be talking about
some time to get them (getting them on Christmas Eve is too late).  </p>

<p>I’ve been a fan of Christmas music for some time, but I was never able to find
something good. Most of what I listened to, was of bad quality, it all sounded
pretty much the same and it seemed like it was made in a hurry and with just
money in mind. I guess that’s the sad part of Christmas music - it’s easy and
cheap to make and everyone will try making it, which means there’s so much
crap out there. But fortunately there’s also a lot of great heartwarming
Christmas music, you just have to find it. Last year, as a combination of luck
and frustration, I found a couple of Christmas albums which I just love and
today, I wanted to share them with you. Hopefully you’ll enjoy them as much as
I do and they will bring you some Christmas cheer.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fimages2Fvince_guaraldi_trio3Aa_charlie_brown_christmas.jpeg" alt="" /><br />
The first one is my favourite Christmas album ever. Most of you will know it,
but whoever doesn’t, should listen to it as soon as possible. Vince Guaraldi
and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090X4H0
W/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative
=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0090X4H0W">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0090X4H0W" alt="" />.
It’s a perfect combination of holiday playfulness, jazz, warm sounds and of course -
Christmas spirit. It tastes exactly like those roasted nuts and mulled wine
did. It’s on top of my ‘most played albums during holidays’ list. Below is a
little taste of it. Now go and get it!  </p>

<p><img class="small right" src="/img/2Fwikipedia2Fen2F72F7b2FWynton_Marsalis_Christmas_Jazz_Jam.jpg" /></p>

<p>If we’re already at the more jazzy side of Christmas, I have to mention Wynton
Marsalis’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SROHI4/ref
=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325
&amp;creativeASIN=B002SROHI4">Christmas Jazz Jam</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002SROHI4" alt="" />. This one’s a bit
more demanding than A Charlie Brown Christmas, so it may not be to everyone’s
liking, but it’s a great album. It has many wonderful moments like Good King
Wenceslas and O Little Town Of Bethlehem to name just two. Whenever I listen
to this album I feel like it’s putting together two of my favourite things.
Jazz and Christmas. Does it get any better than jazzy Christmas?  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2F32FJPG_2502FMI00022F4542FMI0002454500.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Still on Christmas with jazz, here’s Louis Armstrong &amp; Friends doing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005KPO/ref=as_li_tf_
tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeA
SIN=B000005KPO">What a
Wonderful Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000005KPO" alt="" />. When I first heard
it, I was a bit disappointed to hear there are only 6 out of 14 songs by
Louis. This makes it more of a compilation with a focus on Satchmo than an
album done by him. Nevertheless it’s a wonderful album that’s easy to enjoy.
It features names like <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, Duke Ellington, Peggy Lee, Louis Jordan and Lena Horne. All
in all, it’s an even better combination than Christmas Jazz Jam - Jazz and
Christmas AND Louis Armstrong! Just thinking about it, makes me feel all warm
and fuzzy inside. The only thing that leaves you sad after listening to the
album is that Louis Armstrong didn’t record more Christmas songs, because he’s
so incredibly good at it. Here’s Winter Wonderland done by him. Listen and see
what I’m talking about.  </p>

<p>(<a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/2011/12/very-satchmo-christmas-2011-edition.html">Here’s</a> a post about it in Ricky Riccardi’s blog)  </p>

<p>That’s it for now but I’m not done yet. Next time I’ll continue with other
great, maybe a bit unexpected but great Christmas albums. Until then, tell me,
is there anyone else out there who gets excited over Christmas and Christmas
music? What are your favourites?</p>

<p>Here’s a follow-up on the post I did a few days ago. This time around, I’ll
mention a few Christmas albums that are a bit different from the usual stuff.
A kind of change that is very welcomed among Christmas music, that otherwise
sounds the same most of the time.  </p>

<p>First off, it’s the Godfather of Soul - James Brown and his album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001EFD/ref=as_li
_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creat
iveASIN=B000001EFD">James
Brown’s Funky Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000001EFD" alt="" />.
The title pretty
much sums it up and it’s quite an unusual combination, at least for my ears,
but that doesn’t mean it’s not good. If you ask me, it’s actually great. There
are a few misses along the way, but overall it’s a great Christmas album, with
amazing, powerful, <img class="right" src="http://www.funkmysoul.gr/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/james-brown-funky-christmas-300x300.jpg" /> energetic James’ singing. I
definitely recommend it, if you’re in the mood for something different. Listen
to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2GD8nQDxeE">Sweet Little Baby Boy</a> or<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUabyfwVDuI">
Let’s Make Christmas Mean Something This
Year</a> to get a taste of it. Do you
know the song Please Come Home For Christmas? Here’s James Brown’s surprising
rendition. It’s very different from other versions which is exactly why I love
it.  </p>

<p><a href="/2013/01/17/The-First-Lady-Of-Song/">The First Lady of TheSong</a>
recorded Christmas albums too. And good thing she did. Listen to
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WL1Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006WL1Q">Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006WL1Q" alt="" />
to hear how classic
Christmas songs were supposed to be sung. Here’s my favourite on the album,
‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkjz-
6nic8">What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?</a>’.  </p>

<p>Last, but not least is one of my favourite musicians of all time,<a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/08/rainy-night-in-
georgia.html"> Ray
Charles</a>. In 1985, he recorded <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B002D3I1TO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC
ode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002D3I1TO">The Spirit of Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002D3I1TO" alt="" />. Before this year,
<img class="small" src="http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/ella-fitzgerald.jpeg" />
I didn’t even know he recorded a Christmas album. I think I know, which album
I’ll have on repeat this Christmas. The warm, soulful sounds Ray managed to
create time and again, fit perfectly with the Christmas spirit and the result
can be heard on this album. I wouldn’t listen to this album outside the
Christmas season though, for it sounds cheesy at times. But since it is
Christmas, I love it!  </p>

<p>Here’s my favourite on the album, ‘<a href="http://youtu.be/EEeTnZuVcB0?t=4m8s">All I Want For
Christmas</a>’, and don’t let the title scare
you, it’s not Mariah Carey…  </p>

<p>What are your favourites? What do you think of my humble selection? Comments
from anyone are, as always, welcome.<br />
Next time, since a good friend requested it, it’s Otis Redding (if anyone else
has any requests, you should never hesitate!). I’m Looking forward to this
one! I’ll leave you off with a great song, which connects this post and the
next.  </p>

<p>After talking about <a href="/2012/11/03/Sam-Cooke/">Sam
Cooke</a> and
<a href="/2013/01/11/Don't-Give-Up-On-Me/">Solomon Burke</a>, here’s another Soul giant. Otis Redding was one of the
pioneers of Soul music and was truly amazing. He had a signature raspy voice
and amazing ability to convey raw emotion. There are three words that apply
perfectly to what Otis was all about: Passion, Energy and Emotion. He’s
considered to be one of the greatest singers of all time and his singing style
influenced many singers. To name only a few - Al Green, Joe Cocker, Bill
Withers, Janis Joplin, Van Morrison and many others. In fact he’s number 8 on<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202">
</a><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202">Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 100
Singers</a> of all time. He was also highly respected
by The Rolling Stones, who covered his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW-TtMKBCh4">That’s How Strong My Love
Is</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puydDR7gRmU">Pain In My
Heart</a> and in return he covered
their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmnZRBTPzg0">(I Can’t Get No)
Satisfaction</a>. So anyway, if you
know who he was, you know exactly what I’m talking about and if you don’t,
then please, read on, because you’re missing out.<br />
Otis Redding’s first big hit was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqVrNK4uiB4">These Arms Of
Mine</a> but the hits really started
flying about three years later, when he recorded stuff like Mr Pitiful, I’ve
Been Loving You Too Long, I Can’t Turn You Loose, Satisfaction, Respect (out
of which Aretha Franklin later made a huge hit), Shake and others. He mostly
sang just ballads and party tunes and I’m not a big fan of the latter. I mean,
don’t get me wrong, it’s all great stuff, this is just me being very picky.
What I don’t like about those tunes (like
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohkFgdCE2yQ">Shake</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZxN9iQM7OY">Hard To
Handle</a>…) is that they sound
quite simple, they’re done in the same brassy style every time, so after a
while it all sounds a bit repetitive. It wasn’t like this by chance of course,
it was simply because Otis really appreciated the beauty in simplicity. On the
other hand, I’m crazy about his ballads. Songs like Pain In My Heart, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmLjbTBcdU">Try A
Little Tenderness</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJUWn-26jkw">Amen
</a>and others are just too good to
pass on. To me, songs like these showcase his singing and his abilities to
convey emotions powerfully. Listen to Pain in My Heart and listen to how he
sings ‘Love me’ or ‘Come back’. It’s so compelling.  </p>

<p>In 1967, he recorded (Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay. At the time he was
already very successful and he was already considered to be a great singer,
musician and a song-writer but this song took all of that to a whole new
level. It was a breakthrough for him as a musician and it pointed to new
heights that his music might go to. But, just days after it was recorded, one
of the biggest tragedies in the music history happened when he died in a plane
crash. He was 26. I’ll leave you with the song and the enticing question “What
if”.  </p>

<p>P.S. I wrote this post after a friend requested it. If anyone else has any
requests, I would love to hear from you!</p>

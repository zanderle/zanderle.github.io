Last time I wrote a bit about my time in New Orleans
and I thought I would continue talking about it for another post.<br />
On a Sunday afternoon, after walking around the French Quarter for the whole
day, listening to some great music on the streets, having some great seafood,
my girlfriend and I went to hear Kermit Ruffins in Kermit’s Treme Speakeasy
pub. The first time I heard of Kermit was in the Treme series, where he played
himself. I didn’t think much of him at the beginning but I listened to a few
of his albums and immediately started loving his music and now, after seeing
him live, I think he’s such a wonderful person. Kermit Ruffins is a New
Orleans native who’s been playing music since he was a teenager. If anyone
wants to get a quick feeling of New Orleans, you should listen an album of
his.<br />
He is an avid cook, he’s always having a good time, and through his music, he
makes sure everyone else is happy too. In a sense, Kermit, like his great
idol, Louis Armstrong, is just a simple guy trying to draw a smile on your
face with his music. He’s warm, unpretentious and humble.  </p>

<p>We went to many bars in New Orleans, but Kermit’s Treme Speakeasy felt
different. I’ve never been in a bar where I felt so at home. It just felt so
unbelievably cozy and relaxed.  </p>

<p>We noticed right away that pretty much everyone was from the neighbourhood.
You could tell from the way people were talking to each other, the way they
were behaving and the casual clothes they were wearing. Everyone knew everyone
and they were all so friendly. When we came in all the tables were taken, but
right away a couple that offered to share their table with us. The waitress
came to get our order saying “what can I get you, baby?”. Everything and
everyone in that speakeasy made sure we relaxed and had a good time.<br />
Kermit is famous for cooking at his own gigs and this was no different. He
gives away his food during the breaks, but we couldn’t wait for that. We
ordered one portion (the portions in New Orleans are huge) of red beans and
rice with rabbit. We opted for rabbit, because we didn’t feel like some crazy
stuff Kermit always grills like raccoon or possum. It was the best red beans
and rice we’d had thus far and we had them almost every day in New Orleans, so
that says something. Kermit takes his grilling very seriously. He jokes that
he’s actually a master chef who does some music on the side. Well, when you
try his food, you see that that’s not far from the truth. His food is just as
delicious as his music and it tastes the same way - homey, cozy, friendly,
happy, indulgent and just simply good.<br />
Before the show, Kermit was standing by the entrance, saying hi to every guest
and he knew most of them. The way he was greeting everybody and the way he had
so much fun throughout the show, it just felt like he’s having one big house
party every week.The band even had a big ICE box filled with beers by the
bandstand.<br />
His love and respect for Louis Armstrong was definitely visible in his
performance and his choice of songs. The music was wonderful and even though
he was joking all the time, the quality of the music never suffered. Kermit
called a lot of friends on stage to perform with him which just added to the
feeling that this wasn’t a show but a friendly get-together where he and his
Barbecue Swingers played for some friends.  </p>

<p>When you’re in New Orleans, even if it’s just for a few days, you come to
realize that the city is all about delicious, hearty food, friendly people,
wonderful music everywhere and having a good time (Laissez les bons temps
rouler!). Well, that’s what I feel Kermit is also all about. His everyday life
revolves around music, food and indulgence
(<a href="http://www.offbeat.com/2005/06/01/around-the-clock-with-kermit-
ruffins/">here’s</a> a good, but long, article about his everyday life) and in the end,
you can see that his music, food and his bar embodies this New Orleans
personality of his.</p>

<p>This year in September I was in New Orleans. Going to New Orleans had been my
wish for a very long time, but I didn’t want to go before I turned 21, since
most of the bars won’t let you in otherwise. Which means I had a lot of time
to dream about it before I actually went there. I read about it, I read about
the food there, I looked at the pictures, I listened to bands currently
playing in New Orleans, I watched
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1279972/">Treme</a> and so on. When I finally got
there it was everything I expected it to be and so much more. Without a doubt
it’s a city of my dreams. And now, three weeks after the trip, I find myself
missing it more and more. I miss having problems deciding on what live music
I’ll listen to on that day, I miss the amazing food, I miss the unbelievably
kind people, I miss beignets, I miss seeing the wonderful street artists, I
miss forgetting about the time because I enjoy the music so much and most of
all I miss the music I love, being played right in front of me wherever I go.
So I’m writing this, hoping it will make me feel a bit better.  </p>

<p>The Spotted Cat Music Club is a cool place on Frenchmen Street just outside
the French Quarter. It’s quite famous in New Orleans and everyone from around
there will know it. I loved the place from the first day I was there. It was
where I went every night for one last beer before going to bed and it’s where
I heard The New Orleans Jazz Vipers. They’re a band playing traditional jazz
and they’re quite renowned around the Frenchmen street.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWZ7_TArvSs">Here’s</a> an example of what they
sound like. I think it goes without saying that it’s a completely different
thing hearing them live. It’s hearing them live when you can so easily feel
all the energy and joy that they exuberate.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-Rmpt1qZydzY2FUIhc3mbGzFI2FAAAAAAAABOA2F1eHNhrQBUEA2Fs16002F300912_0133.jpg" alt="Jazz Vipers by Žan Anderle" /></p>

<p>All of them are great, but Joe Braun, the saxophone player and singer on some
songs, is really something special. Seeing him on and off the stage, talking
to him and hearing his music gave me something to think about. Off the stage,
he’s actually a quiet, shy guy and when I went to talk to him to tell him how
much I’ve enjoyed their music, he was just so humble and modest. So when he’s
hanging around the bar and on the street, he seems like an average guy, but
when he hits the stage and starts playing, he becomes someone different. His
singing is truly wonderful as is his playing. He puts so much emotion and
energy into it. Listen to him sing and play on “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyFYTE91Wxc&amp;feature=g-crec-u">Lonesome
Me</a>”, a Fats
Waller song. It feels like music isn’t just something he does, it’s a part of
who he is. Without the music, he’s only a shadow of himself. It’s only when
he’s singing and playing that he really becomes himself, and that is what
makes his music so genuine and full of energy.<br />
One day I heard the Jazz Vipers play a song called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLJfBiGDdbE">New
Orleans</a> (they haven’t recorded
it, so here’s a Louis Armstrong version) and Joe was the one who sang it.
Another thing become apparent that day. The way he got serious and happy at
the same time when they started playing this song, the way he sang “just think
of New Orleans” really slowly and the emotions you could feel in his singing
made me realize he must feel a deep connection towards New Orleans. He doesn’t
just like the city, he loves it with all his heart and he wouldn’t want to
live anywhere else, no matter what happened. It’s impossible to explain it
with words, so I’ll just let him explain the way he knows best. Here’s a song
he wrote after Katrina, inviting people to come back to New Orleans “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8bWCDCH3VI">I Hope
You’re Coming Back To New
Orleans</a>”.  </p>

<p>New Orleans really grows on you and if I miss it so much after being there for
only 10 days, I can only imagine what it must mean to someone living there.</p>

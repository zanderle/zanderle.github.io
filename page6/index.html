    <p>James Booker is easily my favourite New Orleans pianist and in light of the
anniversary of his passing (I’m a few days late, I hope it still counts), I
wanted to do a quick post about him.  </p>

<p>Booker is an influential figure in New Orleans music and during his career, he
played with many renowned artists such as Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Dr.
John, Ringo Starr, Fats Domino, Stevie Wonder and many others. Unfortunately,
he’s hardly known outside of New Orleans. I hope I can help change that a
little bit with this post.<br />
In my opinion, his piano playing is just a perfect combination of New Orleans
R’n’B, Blues and Jazz. He takes the best parts of each and puts them together.
I love how his music is so rich and full, but never too intense. For example,
I love the complexities of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmpyZN44BlY">Art Tatum’s piano
playing</a>, but he can be
overwhelming, so I’m not always in the mood for his music. On the other hand,
I’m always in the mood for James Booker.<br />
Here are two examples of his music. If you like him you should get an album of
his, like Junco Partner or a compilation of some kind. I don’t think you’ll
regret it. You’ll get your own taste of New Orleans piano at its best.  </p>

<p>I absolutely love the blues! I started listening to it at about the same time
as jazz and I love it just the same.<br />
My favourite is the acoustic blues. It’s straight on blues without anything to
either enhance it or deprive it of its original sound. I definitely enjoy
other types of blues as well, but there’s just something about the rawness of
the acoustic blues that draws me to it.<br />
With this post, I feel like expounding on it would be thinking about it too
much and feeling it too little. So without further ado, here are a few
examples of acoustic blues or in other words, what I think is a glimpse of the
artist’s pains, problems and sorrows in the form of a song.  </p>

<p>(for these next recordings, try to hear past the bad sound quality)<br />
The amazing Robert Johnson and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8hqGu-leFc">Sweet Home
Chicago</a>. There’s so much to talk
about him, he definitely deserves a post of his own, which I’ll probably write
sometime soon.  </p>

<p>Blind Willie McTell and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENFCVrFffrE">Stole Rider
Blues</a>. He’s a perfect example of
someone I enjoy listening to very much, but can’t explain at all why. It’s
somewhat of mystery to me.  </p>

<p>And here’s something more modern, with a lot better sound quality - Taj Mahal
and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAPF42aAXSM">Stagger Lee</a>. Taj Mahal is
someone who I’ll write about in the future too.  </p>

<p>What about you? Do you like the blues and do you enjoy the acoustic blues as
much as I do? What are some other songs or styles of blues you enjoy? I would
love to hear your opinions.  </p>

<p>Next time I’ll do a post on Solomon Burke, so until then, everyone.</p>

<p>Sam Cooke has, in my opinion, one of the best voices of all time. It’s soft,
full of emotion, it’s reassuring, kind of smokey, creamy and incredibly
soothing. If ever there was a voice which could alleviate pain and hurt, I
think it would be Sam Cooke’s. Listen to his soulful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCE7UNm0aDs">‘Ease My Troublin
Mind’</a> to hear what I mean.
Whenever I feel blue about something, a cup of tea while listening to Sam
Cooke always helps.  </p>

<p>Samuel Cook, born in 1931, began his career with the gospel music. He was so
successful as a gospel singer, that he was afraid to make a transition into
pop music because he didn’t want to disappoint all the religious followers.
Eventually despite his fear he made the transition into secular waters with a
hit song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX6QlnlMqjE">You Send Me</a>. We can all
be grateful he did that, as he is now widely recognized as the forefather of
Soul music, which is a predecessor of funk, modern R&amp;B and others, and because
he gave rise to the likes of Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Solomon Burke,
etc. If it weren’t for Sam Cooke, we would be deprived of a lot of wonderful,
soulful music.<br />
If you’re not sure what soul music is, listen to<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCTZM-dVk_E"> this short recording
</a>of Sam Cooke humming. I feel that
within these 8 bars he explains it much better than anyone could with 8 pages
of writing.  </p>

<p>Seeing as he was a pioneer of soul music, you could say he was exploring new
territory. He had to find a balance between secular pop music and religious
gospel and spiritual music and he was bound to have some misses. I feel like
some of his pop tunes were quite awful, but in the end he found his style. His
album ‘Night Beat’ is phenomenal and is one of my favourite albums. It’s warm,
emotional, bluesy, contemplative and easy to listen to. I strongly recommend
it to anyone. Give it a listen! If you’re not sure you would like it,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58gDMjDbc8">here’s</a> little taste of it.  </p>

<p>Sam Cooke wrote and recorded innumerable great and memorable songs, but there
is one which goes above and beyond and is the most important song he ever
made, if you ask me. Inspired by Bob Dylan’s ‘Blowing In the Wind’ and drawing
from his own experiences, he wrote a stirring and profound song about civil
rights, called ‘A Change Is Gonna Come’. I think it’s a song everybody has to
hear at least once in their life. It has been covered many times and it became
an anthem for the African-American civil right movement in the 60’s. If you
just listen to it without any knowledge of the background, it’s already a
compelling and potent piece of music, but once you place it in its time and
context, it becomes something more than just a tune. It becomes a haunting
embodiment of things that were happening at the time. On top of all that, the
song is very personal - while touring, he experienced the injustices
happening in the States firsthand, and not long before Sam wrote the song, his
18 months old son drowned. All of this is reflected in ‘There were times when
I thought I couldn’t last for long, but now I think I’m able to carry on’ as
well as in the overall weariness and emotion in the song.  </p>

<p>But enough talking already. Just listen to the song and you’ll know exactly
what I meant and much more.  </p>

Last time I wrote a bit about my time in New Orleans
and I thought I would continue talking about it for another post.<br />
On a Sunday afternoon, after walking around the French Quarter for the whole
day, listening to some great music on the streets, having some great seafood,
my girlfriend and I went to hear Kermit Ruffins in Kermit’s Treme Speakeasy
pub. The first time I heard of Kermit was in the Treme series, where he played
himself. I didn’t think much of him at the beginning but I listened to a few
of his albums and immediately started loving his music and now, after seeing
him live, I think he’s such a wonderful person. Kermit Ruffins is a New
Orleans native who’s been playing music since he was a teenager. If anyone
wants to get a quick feeling of New Orleans, you should listen an album of
his.<br />
He is an avid cook, he’s always having a good time, and through his music, he
makes sure everyone else is happy too. In a sense, Kermit, like his great
idol, Louis Armstrong, is just a simple guy trying to draw a smile on your
face with his music. He’s warm, unpretentious and humble.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-jDShhHgBF2k2FUI3Vcx9yXnI2FAAAAAAAABOY2FFlPGlmHWLc82Fs16002F240912_0513.jpg" alt="Kermit's Treme Speakeasy by Žan Anderle" /></p>

<p>We went to many bars in New Orleans, but Kermit’s Treme Speakeasy felt
different. I’ve never been in a bar where I felt so at home. It just felt so
unbelievably cozy and relaxed.  </p>

<p>We noticed right away that pretty much everyone was from the neighbourhood.
You could tell from the way people were talking to each other, the way they
were behaving and the casual clothes they were wearing. Everyone knew everyone
and they were all so friendly. When we came in all the tables were taken, but
right away a couple that offered to share their table with us. The waitress
came to get our order saying “what can I get you, baby?”. Everything and
everyone in that speakeasy made sure we relaxed and had a good time.<br />
Kermit is famous for cooking at his own gigs and this was no different. He
gives away his food during the breaks, but we couldn’t wait for that. We
ordered one portion (the portions in New Orleans are huge) of red beans and
rice with rabbit. We opted for rabbit, because we didn’t feel like some crazy
stuff Kermit always grills like raccoon or possum. It was the best red beans
and rice we’d had thus far and we had them almost every day in New Orleans, so
that says something. Kermit takes his grilling very seriously. He jokes that
he’s actually a master chef who does some music on the side. Well, when you
try his food, you see that that’s not far from the truth. His food is just as
delicious as his music and it tastes the same way - homey, cozy, friendly,
happy, indulgent and just simply good.<br />
Before the show, Kermit was standing by the entrance, saying hi to every guest
and he knew most of them. The way he was greeting everybody and the way he had
so much fun throughout the show, it just felt like he’s having one big house
party every week.The band even had a big ICE box filled with beers by the
bandstand.<br />
His love and respect for Louis Armstrong was definitely visible in his
performance and his choice of songs. The music was wonderful and even though
he was joking all the time, the quality of the music never suffered. Kermit
called a lot of friends on stage to perform with him which just added to the
feeling that this wasn’t a show but a friendly get-together where he and his
Barbecue Swingers played for some friends.  </p>

<p>When you’re in New Orleans, even if it’s just for a few days, you come to
realize that the city is all about delicious, hearty food, friendly people,
wonderful music everywhere and having a good time (Laissez les bons temps
rouler!). Well, that’s what I feel Kermit is also all about. His everyday life
revolves around music, food and indulgence
(<a href="http://www.offbeat.com/2005/06/01/around-the-clock-with-kermit-
ruffins/">here’s</a> a good, but long, article about his everyday life) and in the end,
you can see that his music, food and his bar embodies this New Orleans
personality of his.</p>

<p>This year in September I was in New Orleans. Going to New Orleans had been my
wish for a very long time, but I didn’t want to go before I turned 21, since
most of the bars won’t let you in otherwise. Which means I had a lot of time
to dream about it before I actually went there. I read about it, I read about
the food there, I looked at the pictures, I listened to bands currently
playing in New Orleans, I watched
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1279972/">Treme</a> and so on. When I finally got
there it was everything I expected it to be and so much more. Without a doubt
it’s a city of my dreams. And now, three weeks after the trip, I find myself
missing it more and more. I miss having problems deciding on what live music
I’ll listen to on that day, I miss the amazing food, I miss the unbelievably
kind people, I miss beignets, I miss seeing the wonderful street artists, I
miss forgetting about the time because I enjoy the music so much and most of
all I miss the music I love, being played right in front of me wherever I go.
So I’m writing this, hoping it will make me feel a bit better.  </p>

<p>The Spotted Cat Music Club is a cool place on Frenchmen Street just outside
the French Quarter. It’s quite famous in New Orleans and everyone from around
there will know it. I loved the place from the first day I was there. It was
where I went every night for one last beer before going to bed and it’s where
I heard The New Orleans Jazz Vipers. They’re a band playing traditional jazz
and they’re quite renowned around the Frenchmen street.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWZ7_TArvSs">Here’s</a> an example of what they
sound like. I think it goes without saying that it’s a completely different
thing hearing them live. It’s hearing them live when you can so easily feel
all the energy and joy that they exuberate.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-Rmpt1qZydzY2FUIhc3mbGzFI2FAAAAAAAABOA2F1eHNhrQBUEA2Fs16002F300912_0133.jpg" alt="Jazz Vipers by Žan Anderle" /></p>

<p>All of them are great, but Joe Braun, the saxophone player and singer on some
songs, is really something special. Seeing him on and off the stage, talking
to him and hearing his music gave me something to think about. Off the stage,
he’s actually a quiet, shy guy and when I went to talk to him to tell him how
much I’ve enjoyed their music, he was just so humble and modest. So when he’s
hanging around the bar and on the street, he seems like an average guy, but
when he hits the stage and starts playing, he becomes someone different. His
singing is truly wonderful as is his playing. He puts so much emotion and
energy into it. Listen to him sing and play on “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyFYTE91Wxc&amp;feature=g-crec-u">Lonesome
Me</a>”, a Fats
Waller song. It feels like music isn’t just something he does, it’s a part of
who he is. Without the music, he’s only a shadow of himself. It’s only when
he’s singing and playing that he really becomes himself, and that is what
makes his music so genuine and full of energy.<br />
One day I heard the Jazz Vipers play a song called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLJfBiGDdbE">New
Orleans</a> (they haven’t recorded
it, so here’s a Louis Armstrong version) and Joe was the one who sang it.
Another thing become apparent that day. The way he got serious and happy at
the same time when they started playing this song, the way he sang “just think
of New Orleans” really slowly and the emotions you could feel in his singing
made me realize he must feel a deep connection towards New Orleans. He doesn’t
just like the city, he loves it with all his heart and he wouldn’t want to
live anywhere else, no matter what happened. It’s impossible to explain it
with words, so I’ll just let him explain the way he knows best. Here’s a song
he wrote after Katrina, inviting people to come back to New Orleans “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8bWCDCH3VI">I Hope
You’re Coming Back To New
Orleans</a>”.  </p>

<p>New Orleans really grows on you and if I miss it so much after being there for
only 10 days, I can only imagine what it must mean to someone living there.</p>

<p>Here’s a follow-up on the post I did a few days ago. This time around, I’ll
mention a few Christmas albums that are a bit different from the usual stuff.
A kind of change that is very welcomed among Christmas music, that otherwise
sounds the same most of the time.  </p>

<p>First off, it’s the Godfather of Soul - James Brown and his album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001EFD/ref=as_li
_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creat
iveASIN=B000001EFD">James
Brown’s Funky Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000001EFD" alt="" />.
The title pretty
much sums it up and it’s quite an unusual combination, at least for my ears,
but that doesn’t mean it’s not good. If you ask me, it’s actually great. There
are a few misses along the way, but overall it’s a great Christmas album, with
amazing, powerful, <img class="right" src="http://www.funkmysoul.gr/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/james-brown-funky-christmas-300x300.jpg" /> energetic James’ singing. I
definitely recommend it, if you’re in the mood for something different. Listen
to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2GD8nQDxeE">Sweet Little Baby Boy</a> or<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUabyfwVDuI">
Let’s Make Christmas Mean Something This
Year</a> to get a taste of it. Do you
know the song Please Come Home For Christmas? Here’s James Brown’s surprising
rendition. It’s very different from other versions which is exactly why I love
it.  </p>

<p><a href="/2013/01/17/The-First-Lady-Of-Song/">The First Lady of TheSong</a>
recorded Christmas albums too. And good thing she did. Listen to
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WL1Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006WL1Q">Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006WL1Q" alt="" />
to hear how classic
Christmas songs were supposed to be sung. Here’s my favourite on the album,
‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkjz-
6nic8">What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?</a>’.  </p>

<p>Last, but not least is one of my favourite musicians of all time,<a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/08/rainy-night-in-
georgia.html"> Ray
Charles</a>. In 1985, he recorded <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B002D3I1TO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC
ode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002D3I1TO">The Spirit of Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002D3I1TO" alt="" />. Before this year,
<img class="small" src="http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/ella-fitzgerald.jpeg" />
I didn’t even know he recorded a Christmas album. I think I know, which album
I’ll have on repeat this Christmas. The warm, soulful sounds Ray managed to
create time and again, fit perfectly with the Christmas spirit and the result
can be heard on this album. I wouldn’t listen to this album outside the
Christmas season though, for it sounds cheesy at times. But since it is
Christmas, I love it!  </p>

<p>Here’s my favourite on the album, ‘<a href="http://youtu.be/EEeTnZuVcB0?t=4m8s">All I Want For
Christmas</a>’, and don’t let the title scare
you, it’s not Mariah Carey…  </p>

<p>What are your favourites? What do you think of my humble selection? Comments
from anyone are, as always, welcome.<br />
Next time, since a good friend requested it, it’s Otis Redding (if anyone else
has any requests, you should never hesitate!). I’m Looking forward to this
one! I’ll leave you off with a great song, which connects this post and the
next.  </p>

<p>There are many reasons why I decided to do a Christmas Special. For one, I
LOVE Christmas. As a little kid, I used to count down days till Christmas and
my birthday (which is near Christmas) one month in advance. I don’t do that
anymore, but not much has changed since then. I’m still a little kid who gets
giddy with excitement over Christmas. I can easily get into the Christmas
spirit and I love it! For example a couple of days ago, the first snow of this
winter inspired me to put on Christmas music and prepare some roasted nuts and
mulled wine for my parents and my girlfriend, even though it was just the
beginning of December.<br />
And the reason I’m doing a Christmas special more than two weeks before
Christmas, is because I’m sure there are plenty more people like me out there.
Also, I want to give anyone interested in the albums I’ll be talking about
some time to get them (getting them on Christmas Eve is too late).  </p>

<p>I’ve been a fan of Christmas music for some time, but I was never able to find
something good. Most of what I listened to, was of bad quality, it all sounded
pretty much the same and it seemed like it was made in a hurry and with just
money in mind. I guess that’s the sad part of Christmas music - it’s easy and
cheap to make and everyone will try making it, which means there’s so much
crap out there. But fortunately there’s also a lot of great heartwarming
Christmas music, you just have to find it. Last year, as a combination of luck
and frustration, I found a couple of Christmas albums which I just love and
today, I wanted to share them with you. Hopefully you’ll enjoy them as much as
I do and they will bring you some Christmas cheer.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fimages2Fvince_guaraldi_trio3Aa_charlie_brown_christmas.jpeg" alt="" /><br />
The first one is my favourite Christmas album ever. Most of you will know it,
but whoever doesn’t, should listen to it as soon as possible. Vince Guaraldi
and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090X4H0
W/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative
=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0090X4H0W">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0090X4H0W" alt="" />.
It’s a perfect combination of holiday playfulness, jazz, warm sounds and of course -
Christmas spirit. It tastes exactly like those roasted nuts and mulled wine
did. It’s on top of my ‘most played albums during holidays’ list. Below is a
little taste of it. Now go and get it!  </p>

<p><img class="small right" src="/img/2Fwikipedia2Fen2F72F7b2FWynton_Marsalis_Christmas_Jazz_Jam.jpg" /></p>

<p>If we’re already at the more jazzy side of Christmas, I have to mention Wynton
Marsalis’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SROHI4/ref
=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325
&amp;creativeASIN=B002SROHI4">Christmas Jazz Jam</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002SROHI4" alt="" />. This one’s a bit
more demanding than A Charlie Brown Christmas, so it may not be to everyone’s
liking, but it’s a great album. It has many wonderful moments like Good King
Wenceslas and O Little Town Of Bethlehem to name just two. Whenever I listen
to this album I feel like it’s putting together two of my favourite things.
Jazz and Christmas. Does it get any better than jazzy Christmas?  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2F32FJPG_2502FMI00022F4542FMI0002454500.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Still on Christmas with jazz, here’s Louis Armstrong &amp; Friends doing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005KPO/ref=as_li_tf_
tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeA
SIN=B000005KPO">What a
Wonderful Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000005KPO" alt="" />. When I first heard
it, I was a bit disappointed to hear there are only 6 out of 14 songs by
Louis. This makes it more of a compilation with a focus on Satchmo than an
album done by him. Nevertheless it’s a wonderful album that’s easy to enjoy.
It features names like <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, Duke Ellington, Peggy Lee, Louis Jordan and Lena Horne. All
in all, it’s an even better combination than Christmas Jazz Jam - Jazz and
Christmas AND Louis Armstrong! Just thinking about it, makes me feel all warm
and fuzzy inside. The only thing that leaves you sad after listening to the
album is that Louis Armstrong didn’t record more Christmas songs, because he’s
so incredibly good at it. Here’s Winter Wonderland done by him. Listen and see
what I’m talking about.  </p>

<p>(<a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/2011/12/very-satchmo-christmas-2011-edition.html">Here’s</a> a post about it in Ricky Riccardi’s blog)  </p>

<p>That’s it for now but I’m not done yet. Next time I’ll continue with other
great, maybe a bit unexpected but great Christmas albums. Until then, tell me,
is there anyone else out there who gets excited over Christmas and Christmas
music? What are your favourites?</p>

<p>I had something different in mind for today’s post, but something happened
that is just too important not to write about. An American piano legend, Dave
Brubeck, passed away today. He would turn 92 tomorrow. He was known for his
unusual time signatures and poly-rhythms. During his 60 year career, he toured
with names like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker and Dizzy
Gillespie. He was featured on Time magazine’s cover - at the time, the second
jazz musician ever to be featured on its cover, with only Louis Armstrong
preceding him.<br />
Most people will know him through songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs">Take
Five</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc34Uj8wlmE">Blue Rondo A La
Turk</a>. Maybe you don’t even know
you know him, but most likely you’ve heard these songs before.<br />
I think he’s very easy to listen to, but he also has so much to offer. I
recommend him to anyone, to long time jazz lovers as well as to people who are
just getting into jazz. He wasn’t being praised so much for nothing…  </p>

<p>His renown, in part, comes from his great album <a href="http://www.amazon.c
om/gp/product/B000002AGN/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode
=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000002AGN">Time Out</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000002AGN" alt="" />
, which is something you have to hear at least once in your life, but the reason I love Dave
Brubeck is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006O9MER8/
ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9

, a project with his wife Iola, created specifically with Louis Armstrong in mind. Regarding the
project much can be found in Ricky Riccardi’s
<a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and book <a href="htt
p://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307473295/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougon
musi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307473295">What a Wonderful World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307473295" alt="" />
. I won’t go into detail about it (I will come back about this as this is material
for a post on its own) but I will say it’s a masterpiece ahead of its time and
it’s one of my favourite Louis Armstrong’s albums.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtTL-Z5EyEY">Here’s</a> a song out of the album.
Iola wrote the lyrics and she meant them to be light and humorous, especially
the part  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They say I look like God.<br />
Could God be black? My God!<br />
If all are made in the image of thee,<br />
Could thou perchance a zebra be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was meant as a joke, but Louis sang them with such seriousness it brings the
song to a whole new level.<br />
Anyway, I’ll talk about the album some other time, I had to at least mention
it. If you want to listen to some great music and hear Louis Armstrong do
something atypical for him, give this album a listen. It’s well worth it!  </p>

<p>A musical legend left us today and left a great legacy. Do the right thing and
go enjoy some of it.  </p>

<p>Come back for more reading as I’ll do a Christmas special later this week!  </p>

<p>This women in jazz series has come to an end and for the last post I decided
to do something different, something special. Today I’ll write about a young
Slovenian jazz singer. Most of the musicians I listen to are from abroad and
are unfortunately not alive anymore, so writing about a young Slovenian singer
is something quite different.<br />
I still remember the day I first heard <a href="http://www.ninastrnad.com/">Nina
Strnad</a> singing. I was watching television to kill
some time and I was rushing through the channels to find something
entertaining. All of a sudden I realized I passed something which was
completely different than all the soap operas, commercials and low-budget
movies on other channels. It felt like a snowball hit me. I stopped browsing,
thinking “what was that?!”. I backed up a few channels and started listening
to some kind of a concert. I turned on the volume and this beautiful, clear
voice started coming out of the speakers. I was mesmerized by this girl’s
singing and shocked that we have this voice in Slovenia and that I hadn’t
heard about her. Immediately I wanted to find out who she was and I got so
excited that I found some new music to listen to (I explained why I get so
excited over new music in <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/eric-clapton-wynton-
marsalis-play-blues.html">this
post</a>). After that, I started paying attention to her name
and whenever I heard she’s playing somewhere, I’d try to go and listen. She
was (and still is) just too good to pass on.<br />
After a couple of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUZIQM8PvQw">concerts and jam sessions this
year</a>, I really got into her
singing and now I always make sure I don’t miss her gigs, and I always
recommend her to my friends - if you ever have a chance to hear her sing, take
it! You won’t be sorry. At the moment, Nina is studying jazz singing in USA,
so any readers from that area, pay attention to her name, and try to catch her
gigs if she’ll have any.<br />
This year she started performing some known popular, although older, Slovenian
songs, but with a jazzy twist, which is just wonderful. I knew most of these
songs before, but I feel like I’m hearing them for the first time when she
does them. I really appreciate that she’s doing her own thing with these
Slovenian songs instead of doing just jazz standards.  </p>

<p>Nina’s gig by Žan Anderle</p>

<p>Last week, she came home because of Thanksgiving in the States and had a
concert at Ljubljana’s castle, which was the inspiration for this post (and it
just so happened that it coincided with my writing about women). Surprisingly,
she sang a lot of songs she had never sung before and it was just spectacular.
Unfortunately, none of these songs are online yet, but I’ll do another post as
soon as they are. The whole concert was amazing but three of my favourite
songs were Four Brothers with its nerve-wrecking tempo (for anyone who knows
the song - she actually sang all the lyrics!), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rkNBH5fbMk">Chaplin’s
Smile</a> with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09iyNDosdCA">beautiful Slovene
translation</a> (which she did by
herself) and most of all Thelonious Monk’s In Walked Bud. I love Thelonious
Monk and I love this song and I feel like she sang it exactly the way it was
supposed to be sung. I was trying to find a version which would resemble her
performance, but without any luck. The closest, I would say, is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxdEYbMuA8s">Carmen
McRea’s version</a>, but even that’s
not close enough. She was just that good.<br />
I genuinely appreciate the things she’s doing with the Slovenian songs, but I
hope she’ll also continue with the stuff she was doing at this concert,
because it was phenomenal.  </p>

<p>I apologize I can’t supply more musical material with the post, but I wanted
to write about her regardless of that, because I think she’s a Slovenian gem
and because she’s actually my favourite female singer, who is still alive.  </p>

<p>Thoughts, anyone?</p>

<p>I’ve put this women in jazz series on hold for now, as I want to prepare
something different and special for the last one. For now, I wanted to write
about something unrelated to that, so I decided to write about Stevie Wonder.<br />
I’m sure he doesn’t need much introduction, since pretty much everyone knows
of him. He was born Steveland Hardaway Judkins in 1950 and was blind almost
from the day he was born. He began singing in a church choir and began
learning piano, drums and harmonica at the age of nine. Today, Wonder plays
the piano, synthesizer, harmonica, congas, drums, bass guitar, bongos, organ,
melodica, and clavinet. He began his musical career in 1962, when he was only
12, which makes his career span over a respectful 50 years.  </p>

<p>I don’t enjoy all of his music (I Just Called To Say I Love You, for example),
but there are three albums that are perfection and that make me love and
respect Stevie Wonder and call him a living legend. They are, as he has always
been, optimistic and cheerful. Website
<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">allmusic.com</a> describes it so well: “His best
records were a richly eclectic brew of soul, funk, rock &amp; roll, sophisticated
Broadway/Tin Pan Alley-style pop, jazz, reggae, and African elements – and
they weren’t just stylistic exercises; Wonder took it all and forged it into
his own personal form of expression”. Whenever I need a dose of optimism and
energy, I put on one of these albums and it works like a charm every time. I
don’t know about you, but I personally cannot stand still while listening to
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhw_zbvxvb4">Superstition</a>. I believe it’s
physically impossible. These three albums I love are Talking Book,
Innervisions and Songs In The Key Of Life. Listen to at least one of them (or
preferably all three) to hear the genius of Stevie Wonder firsthand.  </p>

<p>As I’ve said, I recommend all three of them, but Talking Book might be the
best place to start - it’s the easiest to get your head around. It has
beautiful love songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0Y9P45XYUc">I
Believe</a> and it also has one of
his best songs ever (if you ask me);<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhw_zbvxvb4">
Superstition</a>. What I find
interesting is that the album is recorded almost solely by Stevie Wonder. He
didn’t have any help on some songs, while others feature some great names in
music, like for example Jeff Beck on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY2fz5RBgvQ">Looking For Another Pure
Love</a>.<br />
Innervisions is a bit more socially and politically oriented and might be a
bit harder to listen to, if you’re not used to these sounds, but nevertheless
a great album. My favourite from this album is definitely <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOz3p6k5O2g">Don’t You Worry
‘Bout A Thing</a>, with its great
rhythm and groove.<br />
Last but absolutely not the least is Songs In The Key Of Life. Many say it’s
the pinnacle of Stevie Wonder’s career. I’m not going to talk about how
amazingly good the album is (which it is, and if you’re interested, you can
read a good review of the album here), but I’d rather just name two of my
favourites songs on the album. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvkjuEAwgU">Isn’t She
Lovely</a>, one of his most known
songs is just a pure pleasure to listen to. The whole song is wonderful, but
his harmonica solo is incredible. He wrote the song for his daughter, which
gives it slightly melancholic undertones - just listen to the lyrics and
think about the fact that he’s blind and will never be able to see his
daughter. The interesting part though, is that he probably doesn’t think of it
this way, seeing as he’s generally so optimistic and cheerful and never
considered being blind as a disadvantage. In any case, Isn’t She Lovely is a
typical Stevie Wonder song and I love it.<br />
The next favourite from the album is Sir Duke, a song written as a tribute to
the great Duke Ellington (I will be talking about him in the future) and music
in general. No words here, just listen.  </p>

<p>I’m sure everyone has a favourite Stevie Wonder song, so please share!</p>

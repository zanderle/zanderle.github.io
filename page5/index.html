<p>Ugh, I haven’t posted in almost two weeks now, it’s almost like I slept
through the holidays. Anyway I’m back now, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<p>Roberta Flack, there’s an amazing singer! I’m not sure why I haven’t written
about her in <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/search/label/Women">my women in jazz
series</a>, but I’m
making up for it now. I was introduced to her music by a good friend last year
and I’m still grateful.<br />
Roberta Flack is a singer and a songwriter, born in 1939 and most notably
known for her hits in the 70’s. If you’ve never heard of her, you probably
know her by her famous “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1eOsMc2Fgg">Killing Me Softly With His
Song</a>”, which won her a Grammy in
1974. Another quite renowned song she recorded is “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOFrGbuUqnQ">The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face</a>”.<br />
I don’t care too much for either of these songs and I’m not sure why. I guess
they just don’t move me. But I do love and respect Roberta and the reason for
that is her first three albums - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product
/B000002J5S/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=178
9&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000002J5S">First Take</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000002J5S" alt="" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002I60/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000002I60">Chapter Two</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000002I60" alt="" />
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KRTA4G/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004KRTA4G">Quiet Fire</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004KRTA4G" alt="" />
. They’re soft, sophisticated and soulful. In life in general, I appreciate things that slowly
build up to their peak, may that be in music, movies, books, shows or food. I
feel that if something builds up to its full intensity gradually, it’s much
more powerful than it would be, if it was as forceful from the very beginning.
And I’m saying this, because I think songs in these albums provide just that -
a wonderful slow build-up. That, of course, doesn’t mean there’s not much
happening, it means they’re really powerful and strong.<br />
Her music on these albums is like the ocean waves hitting the shore - at first
glance it seems slow, quiet and serene but in reality it has so much power and
energy.<br />
These three albums are amazing and I highly recommend them. Here are two songs
to get a feeling of what kind of music to expect.</p>

<p>Roberta is still creating new music. Just last year she recorded an album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00687XM22/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00687XM22">Let
It Be Roberta: Roberta Flack Sings The Beatles</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00687XM22" alt="" />
. I really like The Beatles and I used to be obsessed with them so when I saw that she made an
album full of their songs I was excited. As soon as I started listening to the
album, the excitement was replaced with disappointment. With the exception of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ZqvbQw-YY&amp;feature=youtu.be">one song</a>, it’s
an awful album (at least to my ears anyway). You know, how sometimes older
people try to sound young and hip but they end up just sounding awkward? Well
that’s how I feel about this album. It sounds like she did some stuff on it
just because “it’s what young people listen to these days”, instead of doing
her own thing. For the better part of the album I was shaking my head, and
asking myself “why?”. As much as I enjoy Roberta’s early music, this is one
album I probably won’t listen to again.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you have a Roberta Flack favourite? As always, I really
appreciate any kind of comments.</p>

<p>After talking about <a href="/2012/11/04/Sam-Cooke/">Sam
Cooke</a> and
<a href="/2013/01/11/Don't-Give-Up-On-Me/">Solomon Burke</a>, here’s another Soul giant. Otis Redding was one of the
pioneers of Soul music and was truly amazing. He had a signature raspy voice
and amazing ability to convey raw emotion. There are three words that apply
perfectly to what Otis was all about: Passion, Energy and Emotion. He’s
considered to be one of the greatest singers of all time and his singing style
influenced many singers. To name only a few - Al Green, Joe Cocker, Bill
Withers, Janis Joplin, Van Morrison and many others. In fact he’s number 8 on<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202">
</a><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202">Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 100
Singers</a> of all time. He was also highly respected
by The Rolling Stones, who covered his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW-TtMKBCh4">That’s How Strong My Love
Is</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puydDR7gRmU">Pain In My
Heart</a> and in return he covered
their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmnZRBTPzg0">(I Can’t Get No)
Satisfaction</a>. So anyway, if you
know who he was, you know exactly what I’m talking about and if you don’t,
then please, read on, because you’re missing out.<br />
Otis Redding’s first big hit was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqVrNK4uiB4">These Arms Of
Mine</a> but the hits really started
flying about three years later, when he recorded stuff like Mr Pitiful, I’ve
Been Loving You Too Long, I Can’t Turn You Loose, Satisfaction, Respect (out
of which Aretha Franklin later made a huge hit), Shake and others. He mostly
sang just ballads and party tunes and I’m not a big fan of the latter. I mean,
don’t get me wrong, it’s all great stuff, this is just me being very picky.
What I don’t like about those tunes (like
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohkFgdCE2yQ">Shake</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZxN9iQM7OY">Hard To
Handle</a>…) is that they sound
quite simple, they’re done in the same brassy style every time, so after a
while it all sounds a bit repetitive. It wasn’t like this by chance of course,
it was simply because Otis really appreciated the beauty in simplicity. On the
other hand, I’m crazy about his ballads. Songs like Pain In My Heart, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmLjbTBcdU">Try A
Little Tenderness</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJUWn-26jkw">Amen
</a>and others are just too good to
pass on. To me, songs like these showcase his singing and his abilities to
convey emotions powerfully. Listen to Pain in My Heart and listen to how he
sings ‘Love me’ or ‘Come back’. It’s so compelling.</p>

<p>In 1967, he recorded (Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay. At the time he was
already very successful and he was already considered to be a great singer,
musician and a song-writer but this song took all of that to a whole new
level. It was a breakthrough for him as a musician and it pointed to new
heights that his music might go to. But, just days after it was recorded, one
of the biggest tragedies in the music history happened when he died in a plane
crash. He was 26. I’ll leave you with the song and the enticing question “What
if”.</p>

<p>P.S. I wrote this post after a friend requested it. If anyone else has any
requests, I would love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Here’s a follow-up on the post I did a few days ago. This time around, I’ll
mention a few Christmas albums that are a bit different from the usual stuff.
A kind of change that is very welcomed among Christmas music, that otherwise
sounds the same most of the time.</p>

<p>First off, it’s the Godfather of Soul - James Brown and his album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001EFD/ref=as_li
_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creat
iveASIN=B000001EFD">James
Brown’s Funky Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000001EFD" alt="" />.
The title pretty
much sums it up and it’s quite an unusual combination, at least for my ears,
but that doesn’t mean it’s not good. If you ask me, it’s actually great. There
are a few misses along the way, but overall it’s a great Christmas album, with
amazing, powerful, <img class="right" src="http://www.funkmysoul.gr/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/james-brown-funky-christmas-300x300.jpg" /> energetic James’ singing. I
definitely recommend it, if you’re in the mood for something different. Listen
to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2GD8nQDxeE">Sweet Little Baby Boy</a> or<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUabyfwVDuI">
Let’s Make Christmas Mean Something This
Year</a> to get a taste of it. Do you
know the song Please Come Home For Christmas? Here’s James Brown’s surprising
rendition. It’s very different from other versions which is exactly why I love
it.</p>

<p><a href="/2013/01/17/The-First-Lady-Of-Song/">The First Lady of TheSong</a>
recorded Christmas albums too. And good thing she did. Listen to
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WL1Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006WL1Q">Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006WL1Q" alt="" />
to hear how classic
Christmas songs were supposed to be sung. Here’s my favourite on the album,
‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkjz-
6nic8">What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?</a>’.</p>

<p>Last, but not least is one of my favourite musicians of all time,<a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/08/rainy-night-in-
georgia.html"> Ray
Charles</a>. In 1985, he recorded <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B002D3I1TO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC
ode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002D3I1TO">The Spirit of Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002D3I1TO" alt="" />. Before this year,
<img class="small" src="http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/ella-fitzgerald.jpeg" />
I didn’t even know he recorded a Christmas album. I think I know, which album
I’ll have on repeat this Christmas. The warm, soulful sounds Ray managed to
create time and again, fit perfectly with the Christmas spirit and the result
can be heard on this album. I wouldn’t listen to this album outside the
Christmas season though, for it sounds cheesy at times. But since it is
Christmas, I love it!</p>

<p>Here’s my favourite on the album, ‘<a href="http://youtu.be/EEeTnZuVcB0?t=4m8s">All I Want For
Christmas</a>’, and don’t let the title scare
you, it’s not Mariah Carey…</p>

<p>What are your favourites? What do you think of my humble selection? Comments
from anyone are, as always, welcome.<br />
Next time, since a good friend requested it, it’s Otis Redding (if anyone else
has any requests, you should never hesitate!). I’m Looking forward to this
one! I’ll leave you off with a great song, which connects this post and the
next.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why I decided to do a Christmas Special. For one, I
LOVE Christmas. As a little kid, I used to count down days till Christmas and
my birthday (which is near Christmas) one month in advance. I don’t do that
anymore, but not much has changed since then. I’m still a little kid who gets
giddy with excitement over Christmas. I can easily get into the Christmas
spirit and I love it! For example a couple of days ago, the first snow of this
winter inspired me to put on Christmas music and prepare some roasted nuts and
mulled wine for my parents and my girlfriend, even though it was just the
beginning of December.<br />
And the reason I’m doing a Christmas special more than two weeks before
Christmas, is because I’m sure there are plenty more people like me out there.
Also, I want to give anyone interested in the albums I’ll be talking about
some time to get them (getting them on Christmas Eve is too late).</p>

<p>I’ve been a fan of Christmas music for some time, but I was never able to find
something good. Most of what I listened to, was of bad quality, it all sounded
pretty much the same and it seemed like it was made in a hurry and with just
money in mind. I guess that’s the sad part of Christmas music - it’s easy and
cheap to make and everyone will try making it, which means there’s so much
crap out there. But fortunately there’s also a lot of great heartwarming
Christmas music, you just have to find it. Last year, as a combination of luck
and frustration, I found a couple of Christmas albums which I just love and
today, I wanted to share them with you. Hopefully you’ll enjoy them as much as
I do and they will bring you some Christmas cheer.</p>

The first one is my favourite Christmas album ever. Most of you will know it,
but whoever doesn’t, should listen to it as soon as possible. Vince Guaraldi
and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090X4H0
W/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative
=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0090X4H0W">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0090X4H0W" alt="" />.
It’s a perfect combination of holiday playfulness, jazz, warm sounds and of course -
Christmas spirit. It tastes exactly like those roasted nuts and mulled wine
did. It’s on top of my ‘most played albums during holidays’ list. Below is a
little taste of it. Now go and get it!</p>

<p><img class="small right" src="/img/2Fwikipedia2Fen2F72F7b2FWynton_Marsalis_Christmas_Jazz_Jam.jpg" /></p>

<p>If we’re already at the more jazzy side of Christmas, I have to mention Wynton
Marsalis’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SROHI4/ref
=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325
&amp;creativeASIN=B002SROHI4">Christmas Jazz Jam</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002SROHI4" alt="" />. This one’s a bit
more demanding than A Charlie Brown Christmas, so it may not be to everyone’s
liking, but it’s a great album. It has many wonderful moments like Good King
Wenceslas and O Little Town Of Bethlehem to name just two. Whenever I listen
to this album I feel like it’s putting together two of my favourite things.
Jazz and Christmas. Does it get any better than jazzy Christmas?</p>

<p><img src="/img/2F32FJPG_2502FMI00022F4542FMI0002454500.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Still on Christmas with jazz, here’s Louis Armstrong &amp; Friends doing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005KPO/ref=as_li_tf_
tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeA
SIN=B000005KPO">What a
Wonderful Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000005KPO" alt="" />. When I first heard
it, I was a bit disappointed to hear there are only 6 out of 14 songs by
Louis. This makes it more of a compilation with a focus on Satchmo than an
album done by him. Nevertheless it’s a wonderful album that’s easy to enjoy.
It features names like <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, Duke Ellington, Peggy Lee, Louis Jordan and Lena Horne. All
in all, it’s an even better combination than Christmas Jazz Jam - Jazz and
Christmas AND Louis Armstrong! Just thinking about it, makes me feel all warm
and fuzzy inside. The only thing that leaves you sad after listening to the
album is that Louis Armstrong didn’t record more Christmas songs, because he’s
so incredibly good at it. Here’s Winter Wonderland done by him. Listen and see
what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/2011/12/very-satchmo-christmas-2011-edition.html">Here’s</a> a post about it in Ricky Riccardi’s blog)</p>

<p>That’s it for now but I’m not done yet. Next time I’ll continue with other
great, maybe a bit unexpected but great Christmas albums. Until then, tell me,
is there anyone else out there who gets excited over Christmas and Christmas
music? What are your favourites?</p>

<p>Here’s a singer! Nicknamed ‘Miss Peaches’, Etta James was born in 1938 and her
amazing career spanned from the 50’s to around 2010. She left a great legacy
and a big amount of wonderful music for us to enjoy. If you don’t know her,
you should read on, because in my experience, everyone seems to like Etta
James. Doesn’t matter what music you’re into, there’s a chance you’ll enjoy
Etta.</p>

<p>I started listening to Miss Peaches after a recommendation from a good friend
and she’s been one of my favourite female singers ever since. She has probably
the strongest voice I’ve ever heard in a woman and with it she can sing
whatever she wants. She defies labels and genres, so it’s really hard to say
what she sings, but I’d say it’s a bit of jazz, a bit of blues, a bit of soul,
and a bit of R’n’B. She also didn’t like being put into a category and she
said that she just sings what she sings and it doesn’t really matter what you
call it.<br />
Most people will know her by the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1uunRdQ61M">At
Last</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YApNirMC9gM">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, but there’s more to her
than just those two songs. What I like about her is that it doesn’t matter
what mood I’m in, I can always find an album that’s appropriate. Anyway, I
would recommend you get some kind of Best Of Etta James album, because it’s
hard not to like her, and I doubt you’ll be sorry. Also on the recommended
listening list are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruouKbVXNjA">These Foolish
Things</a> from her Billie Holiday
tribute album and a duet with Dr John - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyMd19sE6U4">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, which I personally think
is probably one of the best duets ever.</p>

<p>Miss James had a turbulent life, which sometimes reminds me of that of Billie
Holiday. She was born to a 14 year old mother, she never met her father, and
throughout her whole life, she was struggling with relationships and drug
addictions. You could say that, like Lady Day, she also not only sang the
blues, but lived the blues. She explains that because she felt the pain, she
could sing the songs the way she did.<br />
Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington were her greatest influences. I talked
about <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-
and-mellow.html">Billie Holiday</a> before and I’ll talk about Dinah Washington next time, since
they’re all connected in a way.<br />
Etta admired Lady Day greatly. I was watching an interview with Etta, in which
she described how the two met in the 50’s. Miss James was only about 17, 18 at
the time and when she met her, Billie was very weak. Her feet were all
swollen, two men had to help her walk around and, as Etta remembers, her hands
were almost like boxing gloves. Etta observed her nervously and eventually
their eyes locked and Billie said to her “don’t ever let this happen to you”.
In hindsight, she found this intriguing and strange and it had haunted her for
a while. The thing is that at the time, she wasn’t into drugs at all, but
later when she got addicted, she remembered that moment and wondered “Why did
she say that to me? Why did she look in my eyes and say that?”. I think it’s
all very interesting how even though she didn’t want it, her idol’s fate got a
hold of her and how that very same idol could foresee it. (this is a nice
thought)</p>

<p>If I had to choose one song to try to introduce someone to Etta James, it
would probably be an obvious choice like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-59strhDLY">All I Could Do Was
Cry</a>. But if I wanted to choose a
song which would showcase her singing, her interpretations, her raw emotions,
it would have to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-
DeWNjyAw">Feeling Uneasy</a>. The song is just filled with pure pain, sorrow and hurt and she
delivers it perfectly. They recorded the album while she was in rehab, and
when they recorded this particular song, the withdrawal was especially bad.
She was in so much pain that she was actually unable to sing the lyrics. All
she could do was shout and moan, so they just let the tape roll and this is
what they came up with. A haunting, painful and poignant piece of music.</p>

<p>What do you think? What about Etta James, do you like her? What are your
experiences with her music? Please, share your thoughts!</p>

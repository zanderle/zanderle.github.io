<p>Yesterday, I did a <a href="/2012/11/19/Etta-James/">post on Etta
James</a> and
I promised I would write about Dinah today, and that led me to start a series
of posts about women in music I listen to. Up next are Ella Fitzgerald, Nina
Simone and some others. So if you’re into that, make sure you check the blog
every now and then. Let’s get right to it.  </p>

<p>Born Ruth Lee Jones in 1924, Dinah Washington was discovered at a talent show
at the age of 15, by Louis Armstrong’s manager Joe Glaser. Since then, she has
been praised greatly as a singer of both blues and  jazz and critics have
given her as much credit as they have given Ella Fitzgerald and Billie
Holiday. Listen to her for half an hour and you’ll know what they were talking
about.<br />
She sang a lot of torch songs - songs about unrequited love, about loving
someone even after they’ve found someone else, songs filled with sorrow and
pain. In a way she could relate to those songs, since she had plenty of
experiences to draw from. She was married 7 times, and after writing about
Etta James and <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a>, it almost sounds like I’m repeating myself. It’s the same story
all over again.<br />
In 1959, she hit the pop market with the hit song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBxVfQTuvI">What a Difference a Day
Makes</a> and while the sound of her
music changed quite a bit, her singing stayed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9zAUZfDV-w">as strong as
ever</a>.<br />
In 1963, she died of a combination of diet pills and alcohol. She was 39 years
old.  </p>

<p>I love her singing and I listen to Mad About The Boy - The Best Of Dinah
Washington at least twice a month (in addition to other Dinah’s albums). I
definitely recommend it, and I think it’s actually a nice way to start getting
into jazz, for anyone out there, who might be interested. Her singing is
nothing short of phenomenal. Her smoky, raspy, salty, rich voice, full of
vibrato is just a joy to listen to. Even though she sounds completely
different to Billie Holiday, I think you can actually hear a lot of Billie in
Dinah’s singing.<br />
The best album Dinah Washington ever recorded though, is, in my opinion, Dinah
Jams. It’s a jam session recorded in a studio in Los Angeles with big jazz
cats like Clifford Brown and Max Roach. Here are two songs which perfectly
show her amazing talent (the album itself sounds a bit different than these
two songs, but I wanted to post them, because they represent Dinah better). In
the second song, pay attention to lovely piano backing and the perfect
saxophone accompaniment.  </p>

<p>I love the lyrics of Crazy He Calls me, a song made popular by Billie Holiday.
Although Billie Holiday is my favourite female singer of all time, I think
Dinah delivers this song better.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I say I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>And I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>If he wants them out of the way</em><br />
<em>Crazy he calls me</em><br />
<em>Sure, I’m crazy</em><br />
<em>Crazy in love, I say</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I say I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>And I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>As he wants it, so it will be</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love, you see</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Like the wind that shakes the bough</strong><br />
<strong>He moves me with a smile</strong><br />
<strong>The difficult I’ll do right now</strong><br />
<strong>The impossible will take a little while</strong><br />
<strong>I say I’ll care forever</strong><br />
<strong>And I mean forever</strong><br />
<strong>If I have to hold up the sky</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love am I</strong></p>

<p>I love the witty contrast in the song. I feel like when she sings ‘Crazy he
calls me, sure I’m crazy, crazy in love’ he and she are talking about the same
thing, but seeing it differently. They’re both talking about the same
relationship, they’re both using the same word, yet they don’t have the same
view on it. He sees crazy as are-you-out-of-your-mind crazy, it’s not good to
be this way crazy and she understands it as ‘I’m so deeply in love, it makes
me a bit crazy’, but a good kind of crazy. And anyone can understand it that
way actually.<em>** You could see ‘I say I’ll go through fire and I’ll go through
fire, as he wants it, so it will be’ as something only a person <strong>_not
thinking straight _</strong>would do, and it’s <strong>_not sane_</strong>. Or you could be more
romantic and see it as a<strong>_n inspirational_</strong> thing and admire her deep love
for him.**</em><br />
In the end, both kinds of crazy are actually the same thing, it just depends
on how you look at it and what you have to gain from your perspective; if you
see this crazy as something wonderful as she does, then you can do the
impossible_ <em>‘_The difficult I’ll do right now, the impossible will take a
little while’, otherwise it’s likely that the impossible will stay impossible.
I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be a romantic</em> <em>_and do the
impossible.</em><br />
_  </p>

<p>What do you think about the two songs? What are your favourite Dinah
Washington songs? Comment away.  </p>

<p>Next time, I’ll write about another wonderful female musician. Until then,
everyone.</p>

<p>Here’s a singer! Nicknamed ‘Miss Peaches’, Etta James was born in 1938 and her
amazing career spanned from the 50’s to around 2010. She left a great legacy
and a big amount of wonderful music for us to enjoy. If you don’t know her,
you should read on, because in my experience, everyone seems to like Etta
James. Doesn’t matter what music you’re into, there’s a chance you’ll enjoy
Etta.  </p>

<p>I started listening to Miss Peaches after a recommendation from a good friend
and she’s been one of my favourite female singers ever since. She has probably
the strongest voice I’ve ever heard in a woman and with it she can sing
whatever she wants. She defies labels and genres, so it’s really hard to say
what she sings, but I’d say it’s a bit of jazz, a bit of blues, a bit of soul,
and a bit of R’n’B. She also didn’t like being put into a category and she
said that she just sings what she sings and it doesn’t really matter what you
call it.<br />
Most people will know her by the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1uunRdQ61M">At
Last</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YApNirMC9gM">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, but there’s more to her
than just those two songs. What I like about her is that it doesn’t matter
what mood I’m in, I can always find an album that’s appropriate. Anyway, I
would recommend you get some kind of Best Of Etta James album, because it’s
hard not to like her, and I doubt you’ll be sorry. Also on the recommended
listening list are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruouKbVXNjA">These Foolish
Things</a> from her Billie Holiday
tribute album and a duet with Dr John - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyMd19sE6U4">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, which I personally think
is probably one of the best duets ever.  </p>

<p>Miss James had a turbulent life, which sometimes reminds me of that of Billie
Holiday. She was born to a 14 year old mother, she never met her father, and
throughout her whole life, she was struggling with relationships and drug
addictions. You could say that, like Lady Day, she also not only sang the
blues, but lived the blues. She explains that because she felt the pain, she
could sing the songs the way she did.<br />
Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington were her greatest influences. I talked
about <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-
and-mellow.html">Billie Holiday</a> before and I’ll talk about Dinah Washington next time, since
they’re all connected in a way.<br />
Etta admired Lady Day greatly. I was watching an interview with Etta, in which
she described how the two met in the 50’s. Miss James was only about 17, 18 at
the time and when she met her, Billie was very weak. Her feet were all
swollen, two men had to help her walk around and, as Etta remembers, her hands
were almost like boxing gloves. Etta observed her nervously and eventually
their eyes locked and Billie said to her “don’t ever let this happen to you”.
In hindsight, she found this intriguing and strange and it had haunted her for
a while. The thing is that at the time, she wasn’t into drugs at all, but
later when she got addicted, she remembered that moment and wondered “Why did
she say that to me? Why did she look in my eyes and say that?”. I think it’s
all very interesting how even though she didn’t want it, her idol’s fate got a
hold of her and how that very same idol could foresee it. (this is a nice
thought)  </p>

<p>If I had to choose one song to try to introduce someone to Etta James, it
would probably be an obvious choice like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-59strhDLY">All I Could Do Was
Cry</a>. But if I wanted to choose a
song which would showcase her singing, her interpretations, her raw emotions,
it would have to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-
DeWNjyAw">Feeling Uneasy</a>. The song is just filled with pure pain, sorrow and hurt and she
delivers it perfectly. They recorded the album while she was in rehab, and
when they recorded this particular song, the withdrawal was especially bad.
She was in so much pain that she was actually unable to sing the lyrics. All
she could do was shout and moan, so they just let the tape roll and this is
what they came up with. A haunting, painful and poignant piece of music.  </p>

<p>What do you think? What about Etta James, do you like her? What are your
experiences with her music? Please, share your thoughts!</p>

<p>Sam Cooke has, in my opinion, one of the best voices of all time. It’s soft,
full of emotion, it’s reassuring, kind of smokey, creamy and incredibly
soothing. If ever there was a voice which could alleviate pain and hurt, I
think it would be Sam Cooke’s. Listen to his soulful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCE7UNm0aDs">‘Ease My Troublin
Mind’</a> to hear what I mean.
Whenever I feel blue about something, a cup of tea while listening to Sam
Cooke always helps.  </p>

<p>Samuel Cook, born in 1931, began his career with the gospel music. He was so
successful as a gospel singer, that he was afraid to make a transition into
pop music because he didn’t want to disappoint all the religious followers.
Eventually despite his fear he made the transition into secular waters with a
hit song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX6QlnlMqjE">You Send Me</a>. We can all
be grateful he did that, as he is now widely recognized as the forefather of
Soul music, which is a predecessor of funk, modern R&amp;B and others, and because
he gave rise to the likes of Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Solomon Burke,
etc. If it weren’t for Sam Cooke, we would be deprived of a lot of wonderful,
soulful music.<br />
If you’re not sure what soul music is, listen to<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCTZM-dVk_E"> this short recording
</a>of Sam Cooke humming. I feel that
within these 8 bars he explains it much better than anyone could with 8 pages
of writing.  </p>

<p>Seeing as he was a pioneer of soul music, you could say he was exploring new
territory. He had to find a balance between secular pop music and religious
gospel and spiritual music and he was bound to have some misses. I feel like
some of his pop tunes were quite awful, but in the end he found his style. His
album ‘Night Beat’ is phenomenal and is one of my favourite albums. It’s warm,
emotional, bluesy, contemplative and easy to listen to. I strongly recommend
it to anyone. Give it a listen! If you’re not sure you would like it,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58gDMjDbc8">here’s</a> little taste of it.  </p>

<p>Sam Cooke wrote and recorded innumerable great and memorable songs, but there
is one which goes above and beyond and is the most important song he ever
made, if you ask me. Inspired by Bob Dylan’s ‘Blowing In the Wind’ and drawing
from his own experiences, he wrote a stirring and profound song about civil
rights, called ‘A Change Is Gonna Come’. I think it’s a song everybody has to
hear at least once in their life. It has been covered many times and it became
an anthem for the African-American civil right movement in the 60’s. If you
just listen to it without any knowledge of the background, it’s already a
compelling and potent piece of music, but once you place it in its time and
context, it becomes something more than just a tune. It becomes a haunting
embodiment of things that were happening at the time. On top of all that, the
song is very personal - while touring, he experienced the injustices
happening in the States firsthand, and not long before Sam wrote the song, his
18 months old son drowned. All of this is reflected in ‘There were times when
I thought I couldn’t last for long, but now I think I’m able to carry on’ as
well as in the overall weariness and emotion in the song.  </p>

<p>But enough talking already. Just listen to the song and you’ll know exactly
what I meant and much more.  </p>

Last time I wrote a bit about my time in New Orleans
and I thought I would continue talking about it for another post.<br />
On a Sunday afternoon, after walking around the French Quarter for the whole
day, listening to some great music on the streets, having some great seafood,
my girlfriend and I went to hear Kermit Ruffins in Kermit’s Treme Speakeasy
pub. The first time I heard of Kermit was in the Treme series, where he played
himself. I didn’t think much of him at the beginning but I listened to a few
of his albums and immediately started loving his music and now, after seeing
him live, I think he’s such a wonderful person. Kermit Ruffins is a New
Orleans native who’s been playing music since he was a teenager. If anyone
wants to get a quick feeling of New Orleans, you should listen an album of
his.<br />
He is an avid cook, he’s always having a good time, and through his music, he
makes sure everyone else is happy too. In a sense, Kermit, like his great
idol, Louis Armstrong, is just a simple guy trying to draw a smile on your
face with his music. He’s warm, unpretentious and humble.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-jDShhHgBF2k2FUI3Vcx9yXnI2FAAAAAAAABOY2FFlPGlmHWLc82Fs16002F240912_0513.jpg" alt="Kermit's Treme Speakeasy by Žan Anderle" /></p>

<p>We went to many bars in New Orleans, but Kermit’s Treme Speakeasy felt
different. I’ve never been in a bar where I felt so at home. It just felt so
unbelievably cozy and relaxed.  </p>

<p>We noticed right away that pretty much everyone was from the neighbourhood.
You could tell from the way people were talking to each other, the way they
were behaving and the casual clothes they were wearing. Everyone knew everyone
and they were all so friendly. When we came in all the tables were taken, but
right away a couple that offered to share their table with us. The waitress
came to get our order saying “what can I get you, baby?”. Everything and
everyone in that speakeasy made sure we relaxed and had a good time.<br />
Kermit is famous for cooking at his own gigs and this was no different. He
gives away his food during the breaks, but we couldn’t wait for that. We
ordered one portion (the portions in New Orleans are huge) of red beans and
rice with rabbit. We opted for rabbit, because we didn’t feel like some crazy
stuff Kermit always grills like raccoon or possum. It was the best red beans
and rice we’d had thus far and we had them almost every day in New Orleans, so
that says something. Kermit takes his grilling very seriously. He jokes that
he’s actually a master chef who does some music on the side. Well, when you
try his food, you see that that’s not far from the truth. His food is just as
delicious as his music and it tastes the same way - homey, cozy, friendly,
happy, indulgent and just simply good.<br />
Before the show, Kermit was standing by the entrance, saying hi to every guest
and he knew most of them. The way he was greeting everybody and the way he had
so much fun throughout the show, it just felt like he’s having one big house
party every week.The band even had a big ICE box filled with beers by the
bandstand.<br />
His love and respect for Louis Armstrong was definitely visible in his
performance and his choice of songs. The music was wonderful and even though
he was joking all the time, the quality of the music never suffered. Kermit
called a lot of friends on stage to perform with him which just added to the
feeling that this wasn’t a show but a friendly get-together where he and his
Barbecue Swingers played for some friends.  </p>

<p>When you’re in New Orleans, even if it’s just for a few days, you come to
realize that the city is all about delicious, hearty food, friendly people,
wonderful music everywhere and having a good time (Laissez les bons temps
rouler!). Well, that’s what I feel Kermit is also all about. His everyday life
revolves around music, food and indulgence
(<a href="http://www.offbeat.com/2005/06/01/around-the-clock-with-kermit-
ruffins/">here’s</a> a good, but long, article about his everyday life) and in the end,
you can see that his music, food and his bar embodies this New Orleans
personality of his.</p>

<p>This year in September I was in New Orleans. Going to New Orleans had been my
wish for a very long time, but I didn’t want to go before I turned 21, since
most of the bars won’t let you in otherwise. Which means I had a lot of time
to dream about it before I actually went there. I read about it, I read about
the food there, I looked at the pictures, I listened to bands currently
playing in New Orleans, I watched
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1279972/">Treme</a> and so on. When I finally got
there it was everything I expected it to be and so much more. Without a doubt
it’s a city of my dreams. And now, three weeks after the trip, I find myself
missing it more and more. I miss having problems deciding on what live music
I’ll listen to on that day, I miss the amazing food, I miss the unbelievably
kind people, I miss beignets, I miss seeing the wonderful street artists, I
miss forgetting about the time because I enjoy the music so much and most of
all I miss the music I love, being played right in front of me wherever I go.
So I’m writing this, hoping it will make me feel a bit better.  </p>

<p>The Spotted Cat Music Club is a cool place on Frenchmen Street just outside
the French Quarter. It’s quite famous in New Orleans and everyone from around
there will know it. I loved the place from the first day I was there. It was
where I went every night for one last beer before going to bed and it’s where
I heard The New Orleans Jazz Vipers. They’re a band playing traditional jazz
and they’re quite renowned around the Frenchmen street.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWZ7_TArvSs">Here’s</a> an example of what they
sound like. I think it goes without saying that it’s a completely different
thing hearing them live. It’s hearing them live when you can so easily feel
all the energy and joy that they exuberate.  </p>

<p>All of them are great, but Joe Braun, the saxophone player and singer on some
songs, is really something special. Seeing him on and off the stage, talking
to him and hearing his music gave me something to think about. Off the stage,
he’s actually a quiet, shy guy and when I went to talk to him to tell him how
much I’ve enjoyed their music, he was just so humble and modest. So when he’s
hanging around the bar and on the street, he seems like an average guy, but
when he hits the stage and starts playing, he becomes someone different. His
singing is truly wonderful as is his playing. He puts so much emotion and
energy into it. Listen to him sing and play on “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyFYTE91Wxc&amp;feature=g-crec-u">Lonesome
Me</a>”, a Fats
Waller song. It feels like music isn’t just something he does, it’s a part of
who he is. Without the music, he’s only a shadow of himself. It’s only when
he’s singing and playing that he really becomes himself, and that is what
makes his music so genuine and full of energy.<br />
One day I heard the Jazz Vipers play a song called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLJfBiGDdbE">New
Orleans</a> (they haven’t recorded
it, so here’s a Louis Armstrong version) and Joe was the one who sang it.
Another thing become apparent that day. The way he got serious and happy at
the same time when they started playing this song, the way he sang “just think
of New Orleans” really slowly and the emotions you could feel in his singing
made me realize he must feel a deep connection towards New Orleans. He doesn’t
just like the city, he loves it with all his heart and he wouldn’t want to
live anywhere else, no matter what happened. It’s impossible to explain it
with words, so I’ll just let him explain the way he knows best. Here’s a song
he wrote after Katrina, inviting people to come back to New Orleans “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8bWCDCH3VI">I Hope
You’re Coming Back To New
Orleans</a>”.  </p>

<p>New Orleans really grows on you and if I miss it so much after being there for
only 10 days, I can only imagine what it must mean to someone living there.</p>

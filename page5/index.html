    <p><img src="http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/Stevie+Wonder+PNG-1024x906.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’ve put this women in jazz series on hold for now, as I want to prepare
something different and special for the last one. For now, I wanted to write
about something unrelated to that, so I decided to write about Stevie Wonder.<br />
I’m sure he doesn’t need much introduction, since pretty much everyone knows
of him. He was born Steveland Hardaway Judkins in 1950 and was blind almost
from the day he was born. He began singing in a church choir and began
learning piano, drums and harmonica at the age of nine. Today, Wonder plays
the piano, synthesizer, harmonica, congas, drums, bass guitar, bongos, organ,
melodica, and clavinet. He began his musical career in 1962, when he was only
12, which makes his career span over a respectful 50 years.  </p>

<p>I don’t enjoy all of his music (I Just Called To Say I Love You, for example),
but there are three albums that are perfection and that make me love and
respect Stevie Wonder and call him a living legend. They are, as he has always
been, optimistic and cheerful. Website
<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">allmusic.com</a> describes it so well: “His best
records were a richly eclectic brew of soul, funk, rock &amp; roll, sophisticated
Broadway/Tin Pan Alley-style pop, jazz, reggae, and African elements – and
they weren’t just stylistic exercises; Wonder took it all and forged it into
his own personal form of expression”. Whenever I need a dose of optimism and
energy, I put on one of these albums and it works like a charm every time. I
don’t know about you, but I personally cannot stand still while listening to
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhw_zbvxvb4">Superstition</a>. I believe it’s
physically impossible. These three albums I love are Talking Book,
Innervisions and Songs In The Key Of Life. Listen to at least one of them (or
preferably all three) to hear the genius of Stevie Wonder firsthand.  </p>

<p>As I’ve said, I recommend all three of them, but Talking Book might be the
best place to start - it’s the easiest to get your head around. It has
beautiful love songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0Y9P45XYUc">I
Believe</a> and it also has one of
his best songs ever (if you ask me);<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhw_zbvxvb4">
Superstition</a>. What I find
interesting is that the album is recorded almost solely by Stevie Wonder. He
didn’t have any help on some songs, while others feature some great names in
music, like for example Jeff Beck on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY2fz5RBgvQ">Looking For Another Pure
Love</a>.<br />
Innervisions is a bit more socially and politically oriented and might be a
bit harder to listen to, if you’re not used to these sounds, but nevertheless
a great album. My favourite from this album is definitely <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOz3p6k5O2g">Don’t You Worry
‘Bout A Thing</a>, with its great
rhythm and groove.<br />
Last but absolutely not the least is Songs In The Key Of Life. Many say it’s
the pinnacle of Stevie Wonder’s career. I’m not going to talk about how
amazingly good the album is (which it is, and if you’re interested, you can
read a good review of the album here), but I’d rather just name two of my
favourites songs on the album. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvkjuEAwgU">Isn’t She
Lovely</a>, one of his most known
songs is just a pure pleasure to listen to. The whole song is wonderful, but
his harmonica solo is incredible. He wrote the song for his daughter, which
gives it slightly melancholic undertones - just listen to the lyrics and
think about the fact that he’s blind and will never be able to see his
daughter. The interesting part though, is that he probably doesn’t think of it
this way, seeing as he’s generally so optimistic and cheerful and never
considered being blind as a disadvantage. In any case, Isn’t She Lovely is a
typical Stevie Wonder song and I love it.<br />
The next favourite from the album is Sir Duke, a song written as a tribute to
the great Duke Ellington (I will be talking about him in the future) and music
in general. No words here, just listen.  </p>

<p>I’m sure everyone has a favourite Stevie Wonder song, so please share!</p>

<p>I don’t know as much about Nina Simone and her music as I would like to, but I
enjoy her music very much so I decided to do a quick mention of her anyway. I
mean, it is my women in jazz series and she definitely deserves a spot! I will
do another post on her, once I get to know her a bit more, which will happen
soon, because I’m quite intrigued by her. The way she takes on some of the
songs is very interesting and her voice takes a bit of getting used to, I
think, but after that, it becomes great. It is puzzling but is also rewarding
because of that. Another thing I like about her music is that she fills it
with raw emotion. Sometimes you can’t quite put your finger on it, but you can
just feel something strong.<br />
Here are a few examples of my favourite Nina Simone songs. I love her version
of ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDprYZ-tgiA">I Put a Spell On You</a>’, I
feel it’s the best one (and there are many versions of the song out there). I
enjoy the genius irony in ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TarrSrx4v0">I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be
Free</a>’ - the music is so cheerful,
but there’s absolutely nothing cheerful about the lyrics. And because I didn’t
want to put too many examples in this post I decided for only one more song. I
feel ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlN1VR4K-Sk">Nobody’s Fault But Mine</a>’
is a good example of what I was saying about raw emotion. The singing and the
backing piano (which she plays by herself of course) just gets to you. I’ve
listened to the song so many times, but it still grabs me every time, because
I can’t quite get to the bottom of it.  </p>

<p>I can’t wait to do a longer post on Nina Simone. Until then, any thoughts on
her or her music?</p>

<p>Yesterday, I did a <a href="/2012/11/19/Etta-James/">post on Etta
James</a> and
I promised I would write about Dinah today, and that led me to start a series
of posts about women in music I listen to. Up next are Ella Fitzgerald, Nina
Simone and some others. So if you’re into that, make sure you check the blog
every now and then. Let’s get right to it.  </p>

<p>Born Ruth Lee Jones in 1924, Dinah Washington was discovered at a talent show
at the age of 15, by Louis Armstrong’s manager Joe Glaser. Since then, she has
been praised greatly as a singer of both blues and  jazz and critics have
given her as much credit as they have given Ella Fitzgerald and Billie
Holiday. Listen to her for half an hour and you’ll know what they were talking
about.<br />
She sang a lot of torch songs - songs about unrequited love, about loving
someone even after they’ve found someone else, songs filled with sorrow and
pain. In a way she could relate to those songs, since she had plenty of
experiences to draw from. She was married 7 times, and after writing about
Etta James and <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a>, it almost sounds like I’m repeating myself. It’s the same story
all over again.<br />
In 1959, she hit the pop market with the hit song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBxVfQTuvI">What a Difference a Day
Makes</a> and while the sound of her
music changed quite a bit, her singing stayed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9zAUZfDV-w">as strong as
ever</a>.<br />
In 1963, she died of a combination of diet pills and alcohol. She was 39 years
old.  </p>

<p>I love her singing and I listen to Mad About The Boy - The Best Of Dinah
Washington at least twice a month (in addition to other Dinah’s albums). I
definitely recommend it, and I think it’s actually a nice way to start getting
into jazz, for anyone out there, who might be interested. Her singing is
nothing short of phenomenal. Her smoky, raspy, salty, rich voice, full of
vibrato is just a joy to listen to. Even though she sounds completely
different to Billie Holiday, I think you can actually hear a lot of Billie in
Dinah’s singing.<br />
The best album Dinah Washington ever recorded though, is, in my opinion, Dinah
Jams. It’s a jam session recorded in a studio in Los Angeles with big jazz
cats like Clifford Brown and Max Roach. Here are two songs which perfectly
show her amazing talent (the album itself sounds a bit different than these
two songs, but I wanted to post them, because they represent Dinah better). In
the second song, pay attention to lovely piano backing and the perfect
saxophone accompaniment.  </p>

<p>I love the lyrics of Crazy He Calls me, a song made popular by Billie Holiday.
Although Billie Holiday is my favourite female singer of all time, I think
Dinah delivers this song better.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I say I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>And I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>If he wants them out of the way</em><br />
<em>Crazy he calls me</em><br />
<em>Sure, I’m crazy</em><br />
<em>Crazy in love, I say</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I say I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>And I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>As he wants it, so it will be</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love, you see</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Like the wind that shakes the bough</strong><br />
<strong>He moves me with a smile</strong><br />
<strong>The difficult I’ll do right now</strong><br />
<strong>The impossible will take a little while</strong><br />
<strong>I say I’ll care forever</strong><br />
<strong>And I mean forever</strong><br />
<strong>If I have to hold up the sky</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love am I</strong></p>

<p>I love the witty contrast in the song. I feel like when she sings ‘Crazy he
calls me, sure I’m crazy, crazy in love’ he and she are talking about the same
thing, but seeing it differently. They’re both talking about the same
relationship, they’re both using the same word, yet they don’t have the same
view on it. He sees crazy as are-you-out-of-your-mind crazy, it’s not good to
be this way crazy and she understands it as ‘I’m so deeply in love, it makes
me a bit crazy’, but a good kind of crazy. And anyone can understand it that
way actually.<em>** You could see ‘I say I’ll go through fire and I’ll go through
fire, as he wants it, so it will be’ as something only a person <strong>_not
thinking straight _</strong>would do, and it’s <strong>_not sane_</strong>. Or you could be more
romantic and see it as a<strong>_n inspirational_</strong> thing and admire her deep love
for him.**</em><br />
In the end, both kinds of crazy are actually the same thing, it just depends
on how you look at it and what you have to gain from your perspective; if you
see this crazy as something wonderful as she does, then you can do the
impossible_ <em>‘_The difficult I’ll do right now, the impossible will take a
little while’, otherwise it’s likely that the impossible will stay impossible.
I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be a romantic</em> <em>_and do the
impossible.</em><br />
_  </p>

<p>What do you think about the two songs? What are your favourite Dinah
Washington songs? Comment away.  </p>

<p>Next time, I’ll write about another wonderful female musician. Until then,
everyone.</p>

  <article class="content">
    <p><img src="/img/2F20122F012Fetta-james.jpg" alt="Etta James" /></p>

<p>Here’s a singer! Nicknamed ‘Miss Peaches’, Etta James was born in 1938 and her
amazing career spanned from the 50’s to around 2010. She left a great legacy
and a big amount of wonderful music for us to enjoy. If you don’t know her,
you should read on, because in my experience, everyone seems to like Etta
James. Doesn’t matter what music you’re into, there’s a chance you’ll enjoy
Etta.  </p>

<p>I started listening to Miss Peaches after a recommendation from a good friend
and she’s been one of my favourite female singers ever since. She has probably
the strongest voice I’ve ever heard in a woman and with it she can sing
whatever she wants. She defies labels and genres, so it’s really hard to say
what she sings, but I’d say it’s a bit of jazz, a bit of blues, a bit of soul,
and a bit of R’n’B. She also didn’t like being put into a category and she
said that she just sings what she sings and it doesn’t really matter what you
call it.<br />
Most people will know her by the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1uunRdQ61M">At
Last</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YApNirMC9gM">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, but there’s more to her
than just those two songs. What I like about her is that it doesn’t matter
what mood I’m in, I can always find an album that’s appropriate. Anyway, I
would recommend you get some kind of Best Of Etta James album, because it’s
hard not to like her, and I doubt you’ll be sorry. Also on the recommended
listening list are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruouKbVXNjA">These Foolish
Things</a> from her Billie Holiday
tribute album and a duet with Dr John - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyMd19sE6U4">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, which I personally think
is probably one of the best duets ever.  </p>

<p>Miss James had a turbulent life, which sometimes reminds me of that of Billie
Holiday. She was born to a 14 year old mother, she never met her father, and
throughout her whole life, she was struggling with relationships and drug
addictions. You could say that, like Lady Day, she also not only sang the
blues, but lived the blues. She explains that because she felt the pain, she
could sing the songs the way she did.<br />
Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington were her greatest influences. I talked
about <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-
and-mellow.html">Billie Holiday</a> before and I’ll talk about Dinah Washington next time, since
they’re all connected in a way.<br />
Etta admired Lady Day greatly. I was watching an interview with Etta, in which
she described how the two met in the 50’s. Miss James was only about 17, 18 at
the time and when she met her, Billie was very weak. Her feet were all
swollen, two men had to help her walk around and, as Etta remembers, her hands
were almost like boxing gloves. Etta observed her nervously and eventually
their eyes locked and Billie said to her “don’t ever let this happen to you”.
In hindsight, she found this intriguing and strange and it had haunted her for
a while. The thing is that at the time, she wasn’t into drugs at all, but
later when she got addicted, she remembered that moment and wondered “Why did
she say that to me? Why did she look in my eyes and say that?”. I think it’s
all very interesting how even though she didn’t want it, her idol’s fate got a
hold of her and how that very same idol could foresee it. (this is a nice
thought)  </p>

<p>If I had to choose one song to try to introduce someone to Etta James, it
would probably be an obvious choice like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-59strhDLY">All I Could Do Was
Cry</a>. But if I wanted to choose a
song which would showcase her singing, her interpretations, her raw emotions,
it would have to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-
DeWNjyAw">Feeling Uneasy</a>. The song is just filled with pure pain, sorrow and hurt and she
delivers it perfectly. They recorded the album while she was in rehab, and
when they recorded this particular song, the withdrawal was especially bad.
She was in so much pain that she was actually unable to sing the lyrics. All
she could do was shout and moan, so they just let the tape roll and this is
what they came up with. A haunting, painful and poignant piece of music.  </p>

<p>What do you think? What about Etta James, do you like her? What are your
experiences with her music? Please, share your thoughts!</p>

    <p>James Booker is easily my favourite New Orleans pianist and in light of the
anniversary of his passing (I’m a few days late, I hope it still counts), I
wanted to do a quick post about him.  </p>

<p>Booker is an influential figure in New Orleans music and during his career, he
played with many renowned artists such as Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Dr.
John, Ringo Starr, Fats Domino, Stevie Wonder and many others. Unfortunately,
he’s hardly known outside of New Orleans. I hope I can help change that a
little bit with this post.<br />
In my opinion, his piano playing is just a perfect combination of New Orleans
R’n’B, Blues and Jazz. He takes the best parts of each and puts them together.
I love how his music is so rich and full, but never too intense. For example,
I love the complexities of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmpyZN44BlY">Art Tatum’s piano
playing</a>, but he can be
overwhelming, so I’m not always in the mood for his music. On the other hand,
I’m always in the mood for James Booker.<br />
Here are two examples of his music. If you like him you should get an album of
his, like Junco Partner or a compilation of some kind. I don’t think you’ll
regret it. You’ll get your own taste of New Orleans piano at its best.  </p>

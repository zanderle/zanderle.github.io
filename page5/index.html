<p>Yesterday, I did a <a href="/2012/11/19/Etta-James/">post on Etta
James</a> and
I promised I would write about Dinah today, and that led me to start a series
of posts about women in music I listen to. Up next are Ella Fitzgerald, Nina
Simone and some others. So if you’re into that, make sure you check the blog
every now and then. Let’s get right to it.  </p>

<p>Born Ruth Lee Jones in 1924, Dinah Washington was discovered at a talent show
at the age of 15, by Louis Armstrong’s manager Joe Glaser. Since then, she has
been praised greatly as a singer of both blues and  jazz and critics have
given her as much credit as they have given Ella Fitzgerald and Billie
Holiday. Listen to her for half an hour and you’ll know what they were talking
about.<br />
She sang a lot of torch songs - songs about unrequited love, about loving
someone even after they’ve found someone else, songs filled with sorrow and
pain. In a way she could relate to those songs, since she had plenty of
experiences to draw from. She was married 7 times, and after writing about
Etta James and <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a>, it almost sounds like I’m repeating myself. It’s the same story
all over again.<br />
In 1959, she hit the pop market with the hit song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBxVfQTuvI">What a Difference a Day
Makes</a> and while the sound of her
music changed quite a bit, her singing stayed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9zAUZfDV-w">as strong as
ever</a>.<br />
In 1963, she died of a combination of diet pills and alcohol. She was 39 years
old.  </p>

<p>I love her singing and I listen to Mad About The Boy - The Best Of Dinah
Washington at least twice a month (in addition to other Dinah’s albums). I
definitely recommend it, and I think it’s actually a nice way to start getting
into jazz, for anyone out there, who might be interested. Her singing is
nothing short of phenomenal. Her smoky, raspy, salty, rich voice, full of
vibrato is just a joy to listen to. Even though she sounds completely
different to Billie Holiday, I think you can actually hear a lot of Billie in
Dinah’s singing.<br />
The best album Dinah Washington ever recorded though, is, in my opinion, Dinah
Jams. It’s a jam session recorded in a studio in Los Angeles with big jazz
cats like Clifford Brown and Max Roach. Here are two songs which perfectly
show her amazing talent (the album itself sounds a bit different than these
two songs, but I wanted to post them, because they represent Dinah better). In
the second song, pay attention to lovely piano backing and the perfect
saxophone accompaniment.  </p>

<p>I love the lyrics of Crazy He Calls me, a song made popular by Billie Holiday.
Although Billie Holiday is my favourite female singer of all time, I think
Dinah delivers this song better.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I say I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>And I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>If he wants them out of the way</em><br />
<em>Crazy he calls me</em><br />
<em>Sure, I’m crazy</em><br />
<em>Crazy in love, I say</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I say I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>And I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>As he wants it, so it will be</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love, you see</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Like the wind that shakes the bough</strong><br />
<strong>He moves me with a smile</strong><br />
<strong>The difficult I’ll do right now</strong><br />
<strong>The impossible will take a little while</strong><br />
<strong>I say I’ll care forever</strong><br />
<strong>And I mean forever</strong><br />
<strong>If I have to hold up the sky</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love am I</strong></p>

<p>I love the witty contrast in the song. I feel like when she sings ‘Crazy he
calls me, sure I’m crazy, crazy in love’ he and she are talking about the same
thing, but seeing it differently. They’re both talking about the same
relationship, they’re both using the same word, yet they don’t have the same
view on it. He sees crazy as are-you-out-of-your-mind crazy, it’s not good to
be this way crazy and she understands it as ‘I’m so deeply in love, it makes
me a bit crazy’, but a good kind of crazy. And anyone can understand it that
way actually.<em>** You could see ‘I say I’ll go through fire and I’ll go through
fire, as he wants it, so it will be’ as something only a person <strong>_not
thinking straight _</strong>would do, and it’s <strong>_not sane_</strong>. Or you could be more
romantic and see it as a<strong>_n inspirational_</strong> thing and admire her deep love
for him.**</em><br />
In the end, both kinds of crazy are actually the same thing, it just depends
on how you look at it and what you have to gain from your perspective; if you
see this crazy as something wonderful as she does, then you can do the
impossible_ <em>‘_The difficult I’ll do right now, the impossible will take a
little while’, otherwise it’s likely that the impossible will stay impossible.
I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be a romantic</em> <em>_and do the
impossible.</em><br />
_  </p>

<p>What do you think about the two songs? What are your favourite Dinah
Washington songs? Comment away.  </p>

<p>Next time, I’ll write about another wonderful female musician. Until then,
everyone.</p>

<p>Here’s a singer! Nicknamed ‘Miss Peaches’, Etta James was born in 1938 and her
amazing career spanned from the 50’s to around 2010. She left a great legacy
and a big amount of wonderful music for us to enjoy. If you don’t know her,
you should read on, because in my experience, everyone seems to like Etta
James. Doesn’t matter what music you’re into, there’s a chance you’ll enjoy
Etta.  </p>

<p>I started listening to Miss Peaches after a recommendation from a good friend
and she’s been one of my favourite female singers ever since. She has probably
the strongest voice I’ve ever heard in a woman and with it she can sing
whatever she wants. She defies labels and genres, so it’s really hard to say
what she sings, but I’d say it’s a bit of jazz, a bit of blues, a bit of soul,
and a bit of R’n’B. She also didn’t like being put into a category and she
said that she just sings what she sings and it doesn’t really matter what you
call it.<br />
Most people will know her by the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1uunRdQ61M">At
Last</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YApNirMC9gM">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, but there’s more to her
than just those two songs. What I like about her is that it doesn’t matter
what mood I’m in, I can always find an album that’s appropriate. Anyway, I
would recommend you get some kind of Best Of Etta James album, because it’s
hard not to like her, and I doubt you’ll be sorry. Also on the recommended
listening list are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruouKbVXNjA">These Foolish
Things</a> from her Billie Holiday
tribute album and a duet with Dr John - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyMd19sE6U4">I’d Rather Go
Blind</a>, which I personally think
is probably one of the best duets ever.  </p>

<p>Miss James had a turbulent life, which sometimes reminds me of that of Billie
Holiday. She was born to a 14 year old mother, she never met her father, and
throughout her whole life, she was struggling with relationships and drug
addictions. You could say that, like Lady Day, she also not only sang the
blues, but lived the blues. She explains that because she felt the pain, she
could sing the songs the way she did.<br />
Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington were her greatest influences. I talked
about <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-
and-mellow.html">Billie Holiday</a> before and I’ll talk about Dinah Washington next time, since
they’re all connected in a way.<br />
Etta admired Lady Day greatly. I was watching an interview with Etta, in which
she described how the two met in the 50’s. Miss James was only about 17, 18 at
the time and when she met her, Billie was very weak. Her feet were all
swollen, two men had to help her walk around and, as Etta remembers, her hands
were almost like boxing gloves. Etta observed her nervously and eventually
their eyes locked and Billie said to her “don’t ever let this happen to you”.
In hindsight, she found this intriguing and strange and it had haunted her for
a while. The thing is that at the time, she wasn’t into drugs at all, but
later when she got addicted, she remembered that moment and wondered “Why did
she say that to me? Why did she look in my eyes and say that?”. I think it’s
all very interesting how even though she didn’t want it, her idol’s fate got a
hold of her and how that very same idol could foresee it. (this is a nice
thought)  </p>

<p>If I had to choose one song to try to introduce someone to Etta James, it
would probably be an obvious choice like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-59strhDLY">All I Could Do Was
Cry</a>. But if I wanted to choose a
song which would showcase her singing, her interpretations, her raw emotions,
it would have to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-
DeWNjyAw">Feeling Uneasy</a>. The song is just filled with pure pain, sorrow and hurt and she
delivers it perfectly. They recorded the album while she was in rehab, and
when they recorded this particular song, the withdrawal was especially bad.
She was in so much pain that she was actually unable to sing the lyrics. All
she could do was shout and moan, so they just let the tape roll and this is
what they came up with. A haunting, painful and poignant piece of music.  </p>

<p>What do you think? What about Etta James, do you like her? What are your
experiences with her music? Please, share your thoughts!</p>

  <article class="content">
    <p>James Booker is easily my favourite New Orleans pianist and in light of the
anniversary of his passing (I’m a few days late, I hope it still counts), I
wanted to do a quick post about him.  </p>

<p>Booker is an influential figure in New Orleans music and during his career, he
played with many renowned artists such as Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Dr.
John, Ringo Starr, Fats Domino, Stevie Wonder and many others. Unfortunately,
he’s hardly known outside of New Orleans. I hope I can help change that a
little bit with this post.<br />
In my opinion, his piano playing is just a perfect combination of New Orleans
R’n’B, Blues and Jazz. He takes the best parts of each and puts them together.
I love how his music is so rich and full, but never too intense. For example,
I love the complexities of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmpyZN44BlY">Art Tatum’s piano
playing</a>, but he can be
overwhelming, so I’m not always in the mood for his music. On the other hand,
I’m always in the mood for James Booker.<br />
Here are two examples of his music. If you like him you should get an album of
his, like Junco Partner or a compilation of some kind. I don’t think you’ll
regret it. You’ll get your own taste of New Orleans piano at its best.  </p>

<p>I absolutely love the blues! I started listening to it at about the same time
as jazz and I love it just the same.<br />
My favourite is the acoustic blues. It’s straight on blues without anything to
either enhance it or deprive it of its original sound. I definitely enjoy
other types of blues as well, but there’s just something about the rawness of
the acoustic blues that draws me to it.<br />
With this post, I feel like expounding on it would be thinking about it too
much and feeling it too little. So without further ado, here are a few
examples of acoustic blues or in other words, what I think is a glimpse of the
artist’s pains, problems and sorrows in the form of a song.  </p>

<p>(for these next recordings, try to hear past the bad sound quality)<br />
The amazing Robert Johnson and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8hqGu-leFc">Sweet Home
Chicago</a>. There’s so much to talk
about him, he definitely deserves a post of his own, which I’ll probably write
sometime soon.  </p>

<p>Blind Willie McTell and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENFCVrFffrE">Stole Rider
Blues</a>. He’s a perfect example of
someone I enjoy listening to very much, but can’t explain at all why. It’s
somewhat of mystery to me.  </p>

<p>And here’s something more modern, with a lot better sound quality - Taj Mahal
and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAPF42aAXSM">Stagger Lee</a>. Taj Mahal is
someone who I’ll write about in the future too.  </p>

<p>What about you? Do you like the blues and do you enjoy the acoustic blues as
much as I do? What are some other songs or styles of blues you enjoy? I would
love to hear your opinions.  </p>

<p>Next time I’ll do a post on Solomon Burke, so until then, everyone.</p>

<p>Sam Cooke has, in my opinion, one of the best voices of all time. It’s soft,
full of emotion, it’s reassuring, kind of smokey, creamy and incredibly
soothing. If ever there was a voice which could alleviate pain and hurt, I
think it would be Sam Cooke’s. Listen to his soulful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCE7UNm0aDs">‘Ease My Troublin
Mind’</a> to hear what I mean.
Whenever I feel blue about something, a cup of tea while listening to Sam
Cooke always helps.  </p>

<p>Samuel Cook, born in 1931, began his career with the gospel music. He was so
successful as a gospel singer, that he was afraid to make a transition into
pop music because he didn’t want to disappoint all the religious followers.
Eventually despite his fear he made the transition into secular waters with a
hit song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX6QlnlMqjE">You Send Me</a>. We can all
be grateful he did that, as he is now widely recognized as the forefather of
Soul music, which is a predecessor of funk, modern R&amp;B and others, and because
he gave rise to the likes of Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Solomon Burke,
etc. If it weren’t for Sam Cooke, we would be deprived of a lot of wonderful,
soulful music.<br />
If you’re not sure what soul music is, listen to<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCTZM-dVk_E"> this short recording
</a>of Sam Cooke humming. I feel that
within these 8 bars he explains it much better than anyone could with 8 pages
of writing.  </p>

<p>Seeing as he was a pioneer of soul music, you could say he was exploring new
territory. He had to find a balance between secular pop music and religious
gospel and spiritual music and he was bound to have some misses. I feel like
some of his pop tunes were quite awful, but in the end he found his style. His
album ‘Night Beat’ is phenomenal and is one of my favourite albums. It’s warm,
emotional, bluesy, contemplative and easy to listen to. I strongly recommend
it to anyone. Give it a listen! If you’re not sure you would like it,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58gDMjDbc8">here’s</a> little taste of it.  </p>

<p>Sam Cooke wrote and recorded innumerable great and memorable songs, but there
is one which goes above and beyond and is the most important song he ever
made, if you ask me. Inspired by Bob Dylan’s ‘Blowing In the Wind’ and drawing
from his own experiences, he wrote a stirring and profound song about civil
rights, called ‘A Change Is Gonna Come’. I think it’s a song everybody has to
hear at least once in their life. It has been covered many times and it became
an anthem for the African-American civil right movement in the 60’s. If you
just listen to it without any knowledge of the background, it’s already a
compelling and potent piece of music, but once you place it in its time and
context, it becomes something more than just a tune. It becomes a haunting
embodiment of things that were happening at the time. On top of all that, the
song is very personal - while touring, he experienced the injustices
happening in the States firsthand, and not long before Sam wrote the song, his
18 months old son drowned. All of this is reflected in ‘There were times when
I thought I couldn’t last for long, but now I think I’m able to carry on’ as
well as in the overall weariness and emotion in the song.  </p>

<p>But enough talking already. Just listen to the song and you’ll know exactly
what I meant and much more.  </p>

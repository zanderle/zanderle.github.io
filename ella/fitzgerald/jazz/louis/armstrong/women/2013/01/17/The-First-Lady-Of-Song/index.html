<p>The First Lady Of Song</p>

<p>Next up in this women in jazz series is the magnificent Ella Fitzgerald. I
feel a bit intimidated writing about her - she was just that good! Her voice
is probably as pure as it gets. It’s bright, perfectly clear and it’s very
comforting. Her singing is so effortless that she makes it seem like it’s easy
to sing like that. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to have Ella for
a grandma. Whenever someone felt blue, she would just sing their troubles
away. While I love <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a> and <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/11/dinah-
washington.html">Dinah
Washington</a>, they never make me feel as good as Ella always does. It’s
easy to get caught up in her music and forget about your worries.  </p>

<p>I got to know Ella through my love of Louis Armstrong. As you may know, Lady
Ella and Satchmo recorded 3 albums together, all of which are simply golden.
Some people refer to ‘Porgy and Bess’ album as “Sandpaper and whipped cream”.
I personally prefer the first two albums - ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.c
om/gp/product/B00004RD5E/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode

084H9J">Ella and
Louis Again</a><img src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000084H9J" alt="" />’. A combination of
her singing and her exquisite voice, his amazing trumpet playing and his raspy
voice is entrancing. Listen to ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmoiGZuiFQ">They Can’t Take That Away From
Me</a>’ or ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtG9CnMtzZk">Learning The
Blues</a>’ to get a feeling of what
I’m talking about. And even if you’re not interested in what I’m talking
about, just listen to the songs because it’s wonderful music and also because
these albums are probably an example of one of the best collaborations ever.<br />
For some other Ella Fitzgerald’s albums, I would recommend ‘<a href="ht

actually not even that jazzy, so they might be especially appropriate for
someone who’s not that into jazz, but because of Ella’s amazing vocals they
will also be liked by jazz fans. ‘Intimate Ella’ is a good one to get the most
out of her voice, since she’s accompanied only by a piano on this one. Here’s
an example.  </p>

<p>I read about her life the other day and I was quite surprised. Ella was born
and brought up in poverty and she was actually homeless for a year before
starting her career. She hit her big break at a talent show in Harlem. She was
supposed to dance, but after seeing an amazing dance act go on before her, she
got scared and at the last second decided to sing instead. Best last second
decision ever!<br />
Behind the stage, she was actually shy and reserved, which I think no one
would guess because she looked so confident and, in her own words, felt at
home on the stage. Singing is what she lived for. She often felt self-
conscious about her looks and at times even doubted her abilities. How can
someone so talented doubt themselves?! I guess she was still only a human,
like the rest of us, even though she sounded otherworldly.  </p>

<p>What is your favourite Ella Fitzgerald album or song? Your thoughts are
appreciated.</p>

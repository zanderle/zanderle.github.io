<p>For some reason, I’m really afraid of writing about instrumental music. Even
though I really want to, basically all my posts so far have been about music
that includes a singer. After confiding in <a href="http://mitrovic.co/blog/">my
friend</a> about this fear, he made a great suggestion:
we would tell each other which instrumental album to write about on our next
blog post, and just do it. It was exactly the kind of motivation I needed. So
here I am, nervous and afraid, writing my very first post about a piece of
solely instrumental music.</p>

<p>The album my friend chose for me is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006GO9Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006GO9Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">In a Silent Way</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006GO9Q" alt="" /> by Miles Davis. I
usually talk about the artist for a little bit, but if I wanted to talk about
Miles, one whole post probably wouldn’t suffice, so I’ll make it extra brief.
Miles Davis, born in 1926, was a jazz trumpeter and one of the most
influential musicians in the 20th century. For 50 years, he basically kept
inventing new genres and explored jazz in so many new directions (Bebop, Hard
bop, Modal jazz, Fusion, Cool jazz). It’s safe to say that jazz today wouldn’t
be where it is without him. If you don’t know who he is, you might want to
read something about him, as he is one of the most important figures of the
20th century music. Or better yet, listen to some of his classic albums -
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmaQdPoWVGM">Kind Of Blue</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sVapY6JDu8">‘Round About
Midnight</a> or
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38bShXrS7pM">Milestones</a>. Keep in mind though,
that that is only a tiny part of his musical career - what he’s created over
the years ranges far beyond these three albums.</p>

<p>When I first started listening to
jazz and heard about Miles Davis, I just didn’t get it why he’s supposed to be
so good. Sure, I liked Kind Of Blue, but that’s about it. It was making me
kind of annoyed, that everyone was praising him so much. I thought he was
overrated and was frustrated that no one else saw that. Even with this
opinion, I didn’t think his early stuff was bad or anything, whereas the weird
fusion thingy, I just couldn’t take. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7mHNEA7z2U">weird
appearance</a> on stage didn’t help
with that. So, very early on, I decided that I don’t really care for Miles
Davis and that I hate jazz fusion.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-B1a2Tm9SnFk2FUWctVDOlvKI2FAAAAAAAABTY2F-svjWC-iVoo2Fs16002Fmiles-davis-by-jan-persson.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Four years of listening to jazz (but avoiding Miles and anything similar)
later, I suddenly found myself getting more and more interested in Bebop,
Avant-Garde, Modern jazz, all the stuff I thought I didn’t like. Just like
that, Miles’ music eventually crept back to me after all that time. I gave the
albums I knew, another listen and was surprised that this was the same music
as the kind I used to dislike. It sounded differently. I loved it! There were
so many beautiful things happening in the music and I couldn’t understand how
I couldn’t hear that before. Even though I had evidence against me, I kept my
skepticism against Miles.</p>

<p>So when my friend asked me to write about Miles Davis’ album, you can imagine
how I was unsure about that. I thought to myself “how on earth am I going to
write about this?? I’m probably not even going to like it”. Nevertheless, I
decided that, for once in my life, I’ll get out of my own way, and agreed on
the choice. It turns out, I LOVE the album! It’s one of the most intriguing
things I’ve ever heard. As if that wasn’t enough of a surprise, I found out
that In A Silent Way is supposed to be the first fusion album Miles recorded.
. . I was confused, “Wait, aren’t I suppose to hate fusion jazz? But this
sounds so good. How come?”. After a few seconds of thinking about it, the
music took over and it didn’t matter anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmQwzAsOw1k">The album</a> itself is wonderful!
It’s dreamy, contemplative, other-worldly, melancholic, magical and even dark.
I don’t know if I’ve mentioned this before, but I’ve always been fascinated by
dreams and everything related to them. So it’s probably just me, but I feel
like this whole album is about dreams, which is why I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>The first song, Shhh/Peaceful, starts off with just the drums, organ, piano,
bass and guitar letting you look around and get the feeling of what the song
is going to look like. They set the stage for Miles, and when he comes in, he
glides on top of that background, as smooth as ever. Listen to his tone and
articulation. He’s got such control over his instrument, it sounds like it’s
not just a trumpet, but an extension of his thoughts.</p>

<p>The song then goes on and develops like dreams do. And you know how in dreams
something’s always off and even though you’re somehow aware of it, everything
feels just right anyway. Well, listen how the drums provide a really groovy
and quite powerful beat, but the music itself is so mellow and gentle. At
first it sounds a bit off, but after awhile it just feels right.</p>

<p>Another correlation between this song and dreams is how many details the sound
has. No matter where you look, there’s always a detail you didn’t hear before.</p>

<p>The song continues making an impression like that until, just after becoming
slightly turbulent, it rolls off.</p>

<p>At this point, I was already totally in awe, but there was another part, just
as good as the first one. What a treat!</p>

<p>The second song, In a Silent Way/It’s About That Time, begins so darn
beautifully! It sounds so optimistic and hopeful, something like a beautiful
landscape after a storm. After you get a chance to really hear this gorgeous
sound, the flow changes quite abruptly and they start building on top of that.
It feels like this beautiful music is delicate and sensitive, since after a
slight change, everything follows. I guess it sounds like, what I think a
development of an idea in someone’s mind would sound like - from that first
inkling to a full-blown idea. In any case, an amazing second part to this
unbelievable album.</p>

<p>Listening to and thinking about this album was a really wonderful experience.
I sat in a cozy chair, dimmed the lights and set the music to a comfortable
volume. Then I listened. . . I mean really listened. I was shocked by how many
things I could actually hear. If I had listened to this about a year ago, I
would have thought it’s nonsense. I guess I must have had some kind of
invisible earplugs in my ears.</p>

<p>Forty minutes of this dreamy music went by like four minutes. The whole album
is filled with so many thoughts, feelings and emotions, I found myself
thinking about it for some time after it stopped playing. And I love how great
music inspires me to listen to even more music, which is exactly what happened
in the next few days.</p>

<p>I suggest you give In a Silent Way a listen as well. Don’t think about it too
much, just listen and let yourself feel the wonders of music.</p>

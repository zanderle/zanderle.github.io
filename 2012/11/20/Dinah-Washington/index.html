<p>Yesterday, I did a <a href="/2012/11/19/Etta-James/">post on Etta
James</a> and
I promised I would write about Dinah today, and that led me to start a series
of posts about women in music I listen to. Up next are Ella Fitzgerald, Nina
Simone and some others. So if you’re into that, make sure you check the blog
every now and then. Let’s get right to it.  </p>

<p>Born Ruth Lee Jones in 1924, Dinah Washington was discovered at a talent show
at the age of 15, by Louis Armstrong’s manager Joe Glaser. Since then, she has
been praised greatly as a singer of both blues and  jazz and critics have
given her as much credit as they have given Ella Fitzgerald and Billie
Holiday. Listen to her for half an hour and you’ll know what they were talking
about.<br />
She sang a lot of torch songs - songs about unrequited love, about loving
someone even after they’ve found someone else, songs filled with sorrow and
pain. In a way she could relate to those songs, since she had plenty of
experiences to draw from. She was married 7 times, and after writing about
Etta James and <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a>, it almost sounds like I’m repeating myself. It’s the same story
all over again.<br />
In 1959, she hit the pop market with the hit song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBxVfQTuvI">What a Difference a Day
Makes</a> and while the sound of her
music changed quite a bit, her singing stayed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9zAUZfDV-w">as strong as
ever</a>.<br />
In 1963, she died of a combination of diet pills and alcohol. She was 39 years
old.  </p>

<p>I love her singing and I listen to Mad About The Boy - The Best Of Dinah
Washington at least twice a month (in addition to other Dinah’s albums). I
definitely recommend it, and I think it’s actually a nice way to start getting
into jazz, for anyone out there, who might be interested. Her singing is
nothing short of phenomenal. Her smoky, raspy, salty, rich voice, full of
vibrato is just a joy to listen to. Even though she sounds completely
different to Billie Holiday, I think you can actually hear a lot of Billie in
Dinah’s singing.<br />
The best album Dinah Washington ever recorded though, is, in my opinion, Dinah
Jams. It’s a jam session recorded in a studio in Los Angeles with big jazz
cats like Clifford Brown and Max Roach. Here are two songs which perfectly
show her amazing talent (the album itself sounds a bit different than these
two songs, but I wanted to post them, because they represent Dinah better). In
the second song, pay attention to lovely piano backing and the perfect
saxophone accompaniment.  </p>

<p>I love the lyrics of Crazy He Calls me, a song made popular by Billie Holiday.
Although Billie Holiday is my favourite female singer of all time, I think
Dinah delivers this song better.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I say I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>And I’ll move the mountains</em><br />
<em>If he wants them out of the way</em><br />
<em>Crazy he calls me</em><br />
<em>Sure, I’m crazy</em><br />
<em>Crazy in love, I say</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I say I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>And I’ll go through fire</strong><br />
<strong>As he wants it, so it will be</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love, you see</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Like the wind that shakes the bough</strong><br />
<strong>He moves me with a smile</strong><br />
<strong>The difficult I’ll do right now</strong><br />
<strong>The impossible will take a little while</strong><br />
<strong>I say I’ll care forever</strong><br />
<strong>And I mean forever</strong><br />
<strong>If I have to hold up the sky</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy he calls me</strong><br />
<strong>Sure, I’m crazy</strong><br />
<strong>Crazy in love am I</strong></p>

<p>I love the witty contrast in the song. I feel like when she sings ‘Crazy he
calls me, sure I’m crazy, crazy in love’ he and she are talking about the same
thing, but seeing it differently. They’re both talking about the same
relationship, they’re both using the same word, yet they don’t have the same
view on it. He sees crazy as are-you-out-of-your-mind crazy, it’s not good to
be this way crazy and she understands it as ‘I’m so deeply in love, it makes
me a bit crazy’, but a good kind of crazy. And anyone can understand it that
way actually.<em>** You could see ‘I say I’ll go through fire and I’ll go through
fire, as he wants it, so it will be’ as something only a person <strong>_not
thinking straight _</strong>would do, and it’s <strong>_not sane_</strong>. Or you could be more
romantic and see it as a<strong>_n inspirational_</strong> thing and admire her deep love
for him.**</em><br />
In the end, both kinds of crazy are actually the same thing, it just depends
on how you look at it and what you have to gain from your perspective; if you
see this crazy as something wonderful as she does, then you can do the
impossible_ <em>‘_The difficult I’ll do right now, the impossible will take a
little while’, otherwise it’s likely that the impossible will stay impossible.
I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be a romantic</em> <em>_and do the
impossible.</em><br />
_  </p>

<p>What do you think about the two songs? What are your favourite Dinah
Washington songs? Comment away.  </p>

<p>Next time, I’ll write about another wonderful female musician. Until then,
everyone.</p>

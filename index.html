    <p>There are days when I’ll put on one of Satchmo’s records and just love and enjoy the music. Then there are days when I put on his music and listen in admiration. AND THEN there are days when I’m doing something else entirely and simply have some music playing.</p>

<p>Until a certain song comes up and hits me like a train; mind you, a song I’ve listened to countless times before. The song comes up, and in the middle of my work I realize I suddenly stop typing and start listening. Intensely. Not because I’m intrigued, but because I’m stunned. As if I’ve heard it for the first time, I am in awe. The singing, the moans, that beautiful, heart-wrenching solo. And man, that otherworldly glissando.</p>

<p>After listening to what surely must be hundreds of hours of his music, how can his music still sound so fresh?! How can he still surprise me, like I’m hearing him for the first time? I don’t think I’ll ever know. But what a great thing it is.</p>

<p>Finally, Cécile’s new album! I’ve been waiting excitingly the whole summer and I have not been let down. It exceeded my expectations and every time I listen to it, I find new ways to appreciate it. I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed a vocal jazz album so much. And that makes me extremely happy – music like this is rare and precious!</p>

<p>I’ve written <a href="/2014/09/06/Cecile-McLorin-Salvant/">about Cécile McLorin Salvant before</a>; she is an incredible, young singer based in New York. It is often said she extends the lineage of the great singers in jazz before her; Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Bessie Smith. Once you hear her it’s easy to see why. And it’s not just the singers. You can also easily spot other influences, such as Thelonious Monk and Louis Armstrong for example.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already, I recommend you listen to her first album WomanChild. It’s a great start and shows perfectly why she’s so loved and adored by both critics and fans. It’s also interesting to note how it differs from For One to Love. But more about that a bit later.</p>

<p>For One to Love is absolutely striking – Cécile has outdone herself! It’s beautiful, sincere and precious. There’s something about Cécile’s music that draws one in completely. I can’t put a finger on it, but a big part of it has to be the authenticity and intimacy of it.<br />
It’s also exactly what makes this album stand out. It’s not easy to find music like this. And Cécile’s ability to express herself so fully makes it all seem so simple. I love how she has these amazing vocal skills, but never uses them for their own sake. She uses them very deliberately, always to bring a point across. She doesn’t show off. And she doesn’t have to. Her expressiveness is much more powerful than any technical fireworks could ever be.<br />
The incredible broadness of her expression is matched only by her choice in songs. I really appreciate these choices – they’re refreshing. She seamlessly jumps from an original song to a show tune to a standard to a song from a musical back to an original song. Yet no matter the song, she creates magic. This actually reminds me of Louis Armstrong; he could be given any song and create a masterpiece out of it. And Cécile is the same. She picks these songs and makes them say exactly what she wants them to say. She brings such a fresh air to them and makes them feel completely new. And they all fit together, even though they are taken not only from different contexts but also completely different periods! That’s not an easy task.<br />
I mean, listen to what she did with <em>The Trolley Song</em> or how she channels Bessie Smith on <em>What’s the Matter Now?</em>. Or the theatrical performance of <em>Growlin’ Dan</em>. And how all of these sound so fresh and relevant, regardless of their age. Mix in the incomparable originals like <em>Fog</em>, <em>Look at Me</em>, and the heart-breaking <em>Left Over</em> and marvel at how it all fits together.</p>

<p>All of this is amazing. But <em>by far</em> my favorite thing about this album is the intimacy of it. I’ve been listening to her previous album and noticing how it has most of the same qualities I’m talking about here. However it’s not nearly as intimate as this one. Hell, when listening to Cécile on this album it sounds like you’re listening to a friend. You feel you know her. She is telling you a secret. She is bravely and trustingly sharing her experiences. And because of that, the album swallows you whole. It takes you with it. You want to listen what she has to say. You sympathise. You relate to what she’s saying. You want to listen to her talk to you. And because she is so good at expressing herself, you know exactly what she’s talking about. Not understand. You know it, deep down.<br />
This would not be possible, if she didn’t bravely put herself out there. But she did and the results are phenomenal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Singers are often praised for many things, but you rarely hear them commended for bravery. Yet I am convinced that the courage of self-exposure is an especially rare skill, and not the least of the virtues of the finest singers.
If I had the power to award medals for artistic bravery—what a marvelous idea, an honor for courageous love in the musical field, not war on the battlefield!—I wouldn’t hesitate before giving one out for this album. – from liner notes by Ted Giola</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s not forget that all of these amazing qualities shine through partly because of the amazing band that supports her in these creations. Aaron Diehl’s ingenuity on the piano kills me every time.</p>

<p>I seriously love this album. Seeing and hearing what Cecile has shown us so far, I have no doubt that she’s only getting started. I can’t wait to see what’s ahead!</p>

<p>And that makes me happy. Thank you, Cécile.</p>

    <h4 id="louis-armstrongs-lifework-visualized">Louis Armstrong’s lifework visualized</h4>

<p>I’m always excited when I create something that combines my passion with my profession. This is one such project, and I am very happy to share it with you.</p>

<p>Louis Armstrong doesn’t get nearly as much attention as he deserves, given his vast and lasting impact on music. I talked about him more extensively <a href="/2014/11/16/The-One-And-Only-Louis-Armstrong/">in my previous post</a>, but this time I wanted to explore something else. I thought it would be interesting to see his career visualized. To get a closer look into how and when his music got captured on record. So this is my humble attempt at that.</p>

<p>This is a visualization of all sessions that comprise Louis Armstrong’s discography. Each session is represented as a circle. The size of the circle represents the size of the band at that session, and the color is related to the location. The height of each session is given by the quantity of recording dates in a year around that session. So when he was busier recording, the circles will be higher.<br />
The visualization is also interactive. You can zoom in closer to get a better look. Scroll to zoom and click &amp; drag to move around. By hovering over the sessions, you will be able to see the details about them. You can also highlight only specific recording dates; say you are interested in seeing all the recording dates with Jack Teagarden. You simply select his name in the form below and all the sessions with him present, will be highlighted. You can also search by location by clicking the specific location below the graph. Or, if you’re still not satisfied, you could also search for something like “all the sessions that happend in New York with Jack Teagarden, when they played Blueberry Hill”. Just input “Blueberry Hill” and “Jack Teagarden”, click “New York” and the sessions that fit that query will pop up. This means you can do some fun stuff with this visualization.</p>

<p>I invite you to explore it and let me know what you think. Let me know what are some of the things you looked for.</p>

<h3 id="details-about-the-visualizaton">Details about the visualizaton</h3>

<p>The main source of information for this visualization was <a href="http://michaelminn.net/discographies/armstrong/">this online discography</a> by Michael Minn. Some recording dates or radio broadcasts have limited information about the dates, lineups and so on. This means that the uncertainty is also reflected in this visualization. Some sessions are excluded due to the lack of information. There are also some typos and other errors, which I am still cleaning up. If you find anything, let me know.</p>

<p>And a few technical details, for those interested. I used <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> library for the actual visualization. I love it more and more, each time I use it. To get the data from the online discography, I used <a href="http://import.io">import.io</a>. And finally for parsing and cleaning up, Python was the way to go.</p>

<blockquote class="block right image-right">	
“Without music, life would be a mistake.” ― Friedrich Nietzsche
</blockquote>
<p>How often do you hear about jazz being difficult, not accessible and generally something scary? Often? Well, maybe not since talking about jazz scarcely happens in the first place. When it does it tends to have this connotation that jazz is overly complex and not for an everyday man. But is this really the case?<br />
I’m here to tell you a little secret that I’m pretty sure no one has ever told you. Are you ready? Jazz is for <em>everyone</em>! *Gasp* Yes, that includes you. I know, I know, it’s very possible that the mere thought of jazz makes you roll your eyes and think of endless solos that don’t make any sense and that sound… well, weird. Or perhaps you think it’s supposed to be sophisticated and it would be cool to listen to it, but it’s simply too overwhelming and difficult. Whatever the case, it’s likely that you think ‘<em>It’s just not for me</em>’. That’s most people’s relationship to jazz. So I am writing this post because it doesn’t work for me that we live in a world where such an immense art form is mostly overlooked and misunderstood. I honestly believe every single person has a place in their heart for jazz. It is not meant for only a handful of people, but should be enjoyed by everyone. It has so much to give and I really don’t want anyone to miss out on that. Jazz is for everyone, people!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Public image and media are making us believe otherwise. It seems to me that jazz is always portrayed as something that is meant only for a small and chosen minority. This leads to people avoiding jazz altogether. Maybe the thought of listening and liking jazz has simply never crossed their minds, or maybe they see it as something too difficult, therefore not something they would want to get into (i.e., “It’s just not for me”). You might see yourself in here too. I get that and I can relate to that feeling. I used to feel this way some years ago.<br />
And today? Today I see something else. Jazz is incredibly diverse and it is actually such a broad term. The area it covers is vast. One of the reasons I love jazz so much is how diverse it is. Anything that you could possibly imagine and anything that you couldn’t, is covered. There is something for everyone! So when I hear people say that it’s not for them or that it’s difficult to listen to, I know this has more to do with the perception of this music than the reality.<br />
Because you know what’s almost always the case? People hear one or two jazz songs and after they don’t like it they decide jazz is not for them. However not liking some songs says nothing about your relationship to the whole genre. Nobody likes everything. That’s ok and we’re all the same in that. I mean I am what you would call a <em>jazz lover</em> (in case you haven’t noticed already), but there is tons of acclaimed jazz music that I don’t enjoy. You don’t have to like everything, nobody does. But don’t disregard the whole genre because of that.</p>

<p><img src="/img/louis-armstrong4.jpg" alt="Louis Armstrong" class="left image-left medium" /></p>

<p>Before <a href="/2014/07/02/How-I-got-into-jazz/">I started listening to jazz</a> I fell into this trap too. I was pretty certain that I didn’t like it, until it swoop me off my feet one day. Which came as a shock. I didn’t see it coming at all. I’m not saying everyone will go head over heels for jazz like I did - I’m just saying you may not be aware of it yet, but I’m 100% certain there is a place in your heart for jazz.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not promoting everyone should start getting crazy over jazz. Not at all, that would be no good. Diversity in the world is what makes life beautiful. What I am saying though, is that people get afraid of jazz and that shouldn’t happen. It’s such a precious treasure and failing to see its value and treating it like it’s difficult and only for a ‘chosen’ minority is no good. Musicians don’t get the recognition they deserve, and most of the world is missing out on something huge. Something exciting, exquisite, and one of the most honest forms of human communication.</p>

<h2 id="why-jazz">Why jazz?</h2>
<p>The reason I am writing about this is that I passionately believe jazz is one of the finer things life has to offer. It’s far-reaching and speaks to tolerance and encourages individuality and diversity at the same time. It can be exciting or relaxed, intense or mellow, joyful or anguished, sensuous or childish but most importantly it’s always honest. The stories it tells are relevant and relatable. The people who have been creating it come from all walks of life. They are as diverse as they come, but they all share the devotion and passion for music and give it their everything. Simply put, at the end of the day jazz is fun, fulfilling and… it swings!<br />
I’m certain there isn’t a person alive who couldn’t use a piece of that in their lives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jazz music celebrates life! Human life; the range of it, the absurdity of it, the ignorance of it, the greatness of it, the intelligence of it, the sexuality of it, the profundity of it. And it deals with it. In all of its… It deals with it!” - Wynton Marsalis</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>In this day and age where radios and TVs play mostly over-produced soulless music, made with the sole purpose of earning as much money as possible, we are blasted with superficial crap with no originality. It’s intentionally made simple and uses proven hooks that are bound to bring in cash. The commercial radios poison our ears by playing same stuff over and over again. They’d rather play one song a hundred times than play something that deviates from their mold. In turn, they numb our senses and make it harder and harder to be really touched by a piece of music. It is rare or practically impossible to hear something authentic, honest and from the heart. I think that’s awful and no one should stand idly by and suffer that. Music is something that can enrich our lives extensively. And jazz offers that full-heartedly.<br />
Do yourself a favour. Take a step away from the everyday, shallow stuff that’s blasting at you and take the time to enjoy something that’s soulful, honest and courageous. It will put a spark in your life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I was in awe of jazz musicians because of their power, because of the mystery of their sinuous but overwhelming power. Nothing else in my experience was so exhilarating, so utterly compelling. The laughter in the music, the intimacy, the range and bite of the life-tales each player told in textures and cadences entirely his own. The irony, the deep blues, and, as I grew older, the sensuousness.” - Nat Hentoff, Jazz Is</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="ok-lets-do-this">Ok, let’s do this</h2>
<p>So how do you get into jazz? Since it’s so vast, where do you begin, how do you find a piece of it that you enjoy? That’s a whole different story and I will get into that in my next post, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/bc2g2v" target="_blank">stay tuned</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/thelonious_monk.jpg" alt="Thelonious Monk" /></p>

<p>Yesterday an interesting question came to mind: “What do Thelonious Monk and Louis Armstrong have in common. Anything?”. The reason behind this is quite simple. <a href="/2014/11/16/The-One-And-Only-Louis-Armstrong/">I’ve mentioned before</a> that Louis Armstrong is my musical and personal hero. Everything begins and ends with him. Well, Thelonious Monk is a close second. He deserves (and will get) a separate post, but for now I wanted to explore something else. Why is it that both these artists hold such a special place in my heart? Is it just a coincidence or do they maybe have something in common. What intrigued me even further was that they are scarcely mentioned in the same discussions - apart from the fact that they were both incomparable geniuses, who influenced the generations to come. So I wanted to dig into this connection; if there is any. Just for the fun of it. And while I’m at it, write a post about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is immense power and careful logic in the music of Thelonious Sphere Monk. But you might have such a good time listening to it that you might not even notice. That, of course, would be your problem, not his. Monk was an architect of feeling. His tunes were slick, inhabitable little rooms that warmed the heart with their odd angles and bright colors. Somehow he knew exactly how to make you feel good—and I mean exactly, as if it were medicine, or gastronomy, or massage, or feng shui.” - Vijay Iyer on Thelonious Monk. Would apply just as well to Louis Armstrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/louis_armstrong_backstage.jpg" alt="Louis Armstrong" class="right image-right medium" />
Whenever I consider two artist, I usually start thinking about their possible interactions. Did they know each other? What did they think of each other?<br />
Did Louis and Thelonious know each other? Did they mention each other in interviews? I couldn’t find much. For example, you might have heard about the exchanges between Dizzy and Louis back in the day. Well, there wasn’t anything similar happening to heroes of this story. However, I do think they had mutual respect. Thelonious was very aware and respective of the music and musicians before him. After all, he learned to play the piano by performing church music and would develop his style in the company of the most famous stride pianists. It stayed with him for the rest of his life.<br />
Louis Armstrong owned two records by Thelonious Monk. He is also quoted saying “Very personally, I don’t care for most bop, except maybe for Parker, some Miles Davis, some Thelonious Monk.”. Of course there were people who pegged Louis as hating ‘modern music’ and being stuck in his old ways. I think what is a lot closer to Louis Armstrong’s essence is succinctly put as “There is two kinds of music, the good, and the bad”. If it’s good, it’s good and it doesn’t matter if it’s modern or pre-historic.<br />
And can you guess a direct connection that ties these two together? None other than Coleman Hawkins. Hawk played with Louis Armstrong in the Fletcher Henderson band in the 20s and was greatly influenced by him. Well, Thelonious Monk’s career started when he played with Coleman Hawkins, who would be his supporter and a huge influence on the pianist.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When I considered how they were treated by the general public, an unlucky common thread comes up. Monk and Armstrong both experienced the wrath of critics and were (perhaps as a result) often misunderstood by the public. They both experienced endless repeating stories of demeaning categorizations and simplifications.<br />
Before Louis’ career took off there weren’t a lot of magazines and/or critics devoted to jazz, so it wasn’t uncommon to read about jazz being signed off as a joke or worse yet, an offense to music. Once they started talking about Louis they would throw him in the same basket and add a good measure of racism. Later in his career they became less racist but moved on to other things; they generally recognized him as a great artist (at that point it became impossible and quite frankly, stupid, for anyone to deny that), but would say that he sold out and was generally distasteful and offensive. They saw him as an used-to-be. Of course not every critic held this opinion but the ones that did, did enough damage for this made-up/twisted story to keep repeating. It took a long time (20-30 years after his passing) for this general view on Armstrong to change.<br />
It’s funny how much Armstrong was ahead of his time. And that includes his whole career - even though the critics thought they had him all figured out in his later years, he would prove them wrong once again. Monk once said “I say, play your own way. Don’t play what the public want — you play what you want and let the public pick up on what you doing — even if it does take them fifteen, twenty years.”. I am surprised how often this holds true. Not just with these two.<br />
So how about Monk? It took a long time for him to be recognized as a genius. Or even as a passable pianist! When he finally got the recognition he deserves, he was over 40. Before that his music was usually signed off as unlistenable and he was regarded as a subpar musician. More importantly the thing that the critics loved to talk about the most was that he was eccentric, tardy and unreliable. That was a gross oversimplification, but that image stuck with him for the rest of his life. I guess, it was just more interesting and easier for the interviewers to portray him like that, rather than actually seeing him for who he was. Those unflattering stories were hardly anything more than a gossip. If you want to find out more about how ignorant and unjustified those statements were, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439190461/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1439190461&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkId=3MH3A3AA2N57AXIY" target="_blank">a great biography by Robin D.G. Kelley</a>. Thelonious Monk was an introvert and had mental health issues that grew worse and worse. Robin D.G. Kelley clearly shows the line between the truth and this nonsense talk. And reading the stupid questions interviewers had prepared for Monk makes you question their sanity, not his. ‘Do you think piano has enough keys?’ I mean what did they expect to get from questions like that? He had witty responses or sometimes just didn’t respond. Of course this was seen as weird just because it has already been decided that he is weird.<br />
Like Louis, later in his life he was being loved by numerous fans and would generally be accepted as one of the most influential musicians of his time. And unlike Louis, he was also loved by the critics (the same critics who had, years later, said he was unlistenable). Nevertheless just as Louis Armstrong, he was often criticized for performing a routine show.</p>

<h3 id="the-music">The Music</h3>

<p>What about their music? Personally, I think this is what connects them the most. When it comes to music, in a way, Thelonious Monk is like an introvert, more introspective version of Louis Armstrong. They may have different sounds due to a different era, but they hold the same qualities.<br />
They were both masters of their instruments. Like other musical geniuses, they were able to make their instruments sound completely novel and unlike anything heard before or after them. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. They both devoted their whole lives and their whole beings to music. What came out of that life-long devotion was Music with a capital M. Exquisite, delightful and endlessly alluring music. Monk’s music was always juggling between two seemingly contradicting aspects. On one hand he had this assiduous, hard-working and intellectual approach to his music while on the other he always remained so joyful and playful; almost child-like. It takes something, perhaps a touch of genius or a profound understanding of life, to juggle and poise these two aspects. But Monk does it so naturally, so flawlessly, he makes it look easy. Now doesn’t all that sound a lot like Louis Armstrong? Listen to their rendition of Dinah. I think it illustrates this point perfectly.<br />
<span class="font-small">Incidentally, I think <a href="/2014/09/06/Cecile-McLorin-Salvant/">Cecile</a> is a master of this duality as well. It’s what I love about her.</span></p>

<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhVdLd43bDI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Just look and listen to how he dances around on the stage and how he plays with the melody when he is singing. It’s pure joy. But when he puts that horn on his lips, he is possessed. He becomes a man on a mission.</p>

<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKAMNaGO5Y4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This duality was also reflected by their stage demeanor. Monk danced. Louis told jokes and laughed. And when they started playing they left no doubt of their prowess.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Stop playing all those weird notes (that bullshit), play the melody!” - Thelonious Monk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing I find interesting is how they both loved a good melody and would insist in having their music melody-oriented. You can hear this clearly in Armstrong’s later years - if it was a melody he enjoyed, he loved nothing more than to play it without changing it. And just the same in Monk’s solos, where the melody was always right underneath the surface.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pat your foot and sing the melody in your head, when you play.” - Thelonious Monk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As they grew older they both slowly but surely gravitated towards a more mature style of playing. They wouldn’t play ten notes where one was needed. They played <em>exactly</em> what was needed. No more and no less. Perfect in every note and every pause. Even more importantly their music would become more soulful than ever. I already talked about this in my previous post, but it’s worth mentioning again. It’s mind-blowing how much emotion they were able to pack into a single song. More than that, how much intensity they could put in one tone or one chord. You can’t duplicate that.</p>

<p>Monk and Armstrong could not appear more different. Their music not the least so. But was that actually the case? I don’t think it was. We’re often so quick to categorize music and treat it as different beings. We seem to forget that it’s all Music. Maybe I am completely off with this post but I’d like to think they (and this applies to all of us as well) were more similar than they were different. Sure, there are things that separated them, but these things only give the illusion of disconnection. One was an extrovert and the other an introvert. But both incredibly persistent, determined and hard-working. What they have left us is a precious treasure that can never be exhausted.</p>

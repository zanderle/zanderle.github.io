<p><em class="none show-mobile">Unfortunately this interactive visualization is not supported on mobile devices. Come check it out on your tablet or computer.</em></p>

<p>With over 1000 recorded songs spanned over more than 100 albums, Sun Ra was one of the most prolific artists of the 20th century. I decided to make a simple visualization of this enormous body of work. I soon realized, this is no easy task. For one, the discography data is confusing to say the least. For a lot of albums, it is unclear who was in the band or where or when it was recorded. The band members themselves often gave conflicting reports regarding these things. I did my best with the data I could find in the <a href="http://www.the-temple.net/sunradisco/list.php">discography online</a>.<br />
After that confusion, I had to make a decision about which data to show. I eventually decided I am only going to visualize full-length albums (so excluding singles and records where Sun Ra appeared as guest).  </p>

<p>So here it is - a simple timeline of Sun Ra’s recorded work. The albums are positioned on the timeline based on the year they were released (or if they have not been released - when they were recorded). The colors represent the whereabouts of recording sessions. If you hover over specific works, additional information will show up.
I might eventually expand it with some more features, but that’s it for now. I hope you like it :).  </p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

<p><span class="font-small gray">A few technical details, for those interested. I used <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> library for the actual visualization. To get the data from the website I mentioned earlier, I used <a href="http://import.io">import.io</a> (which was a joy to use, if I may add). And finally for parsing and cleaning up, Python was the way to go.</span></p>

<h4 id="i-think-of-myself-as-a-complete-mystery-to-myself--sun-ra">“I think of myself as a complete mystery. To myself.” -Sun Ra</h4>

<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCnls9CyKDI">Recommended listening while reading</a>)</p>

<p>One of my favorite places in the world are record stores. I love the atmosphere and the coziness they possess. To me, a record store is a magical, romantic place to be. It’s where serendipity happens daily. I appreciate the big ones as they are like sanctuaries of Music, but my heart lies with the small, charming record stores owned by lovers of Music. God knows they don’t earn a lot, but they can’t imagine doing anything else. I love how they put their heart and soul into the store and because of it, walking through it is actually so intimate. And that’s the beauty of it. Every record is there for a reason. Behind every item lies a story. Tragically though, record stores are dwindling. They’re being overthrown by internet sales and music departments in super-markets. So I make an effort to support these precious places. 
And that is how I came across Sun Ra (as well as many other gems). I first heard of him in <a href="http://www.jazzandbluesweb.com/">a record store in Ljubljana</a>. Then, when I was in New York I went to <a href="http://www.downtownmusicgallery.com/Main/index.htm">a very special record store in China Town</a> and after scouting for solid 30 minutes I asked the owner to tell me more about Sun Ra and maybe give me a recommendation. His eyes got brighter (this seems to be a common reaction when asking record store owners about Sun Ra). He went on to tell me bunch of stories about Sun Ra, where he saw him live, how he got hooked, then took me over to the CD’s, where he had a story for each one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In some far off place<br />
Many light years in space<br />
I’ll wait for you.<br />
Where human feet have never trod,<br />
Where human eyes have never seen.<br />
I’ll build a world of abstract dreams<br />
And wait for you.”
- Sun Ra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s how I got started with Sun Ra. I didn’t immediately like him. However there’s a certain mysterious aura about him, that sooner or later draws you back whether or not you initially knew it will happen. So after being indifferent at first, I eventually found my way back, wanting to find out more and more about him and his music. I found the less I thought about what it all means, and the more I just let myself go and let the music take me wherever it may, the more I was enjoying it. I guess it’s not for everyone, but I find his music amazing.<br />
I’m astounded by the variety of forms that music can take, all the different meanings it can hold and all the different places it can take you. To me Sun Ra showed that beautifully. He was a bottomless well of artistry and creativity.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until last month, that his music really hit me(and inspired me to write this post). Sun Ra left our Earth in 1992, but his Arkestra continues to perform under Marshall Allen, who used to be in the original Arkestra. Last month, they came to Slovenia to a little town called Cerkno. Cerkno is renowned for hosting many jazz artist (through the festival, Jazz Cerkno). Going there for a concert in itself is an experience - an idyllic town snuggly put between the mountains, that during the festival lives for jazz. When I got there it seemed like the whole town woke up and proceeded to the main square where the concert was held. And the warm summer night with clear skies just added to the warm, homey feeling. Then just as the stars in the sky started to show up, so did the Arkestra - shiny and bright, one by one they came up on stage. Everyone was wearing a thought-out costume, that might consist of a shimmering cape and a hat for example. They were beautiful and otherworldly.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The outer space beings are my brothers. They sent me here. They already know my music.”
- Sun Ra</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/sun-ra-arkestra.jpg" alt="Sun Ra Arkestra" class="right big" /></p>

<p>Then they began to play. Suddenly it all made sense - the music, the costumes, the philosophy, everything. It made perfect sense in that moment. I’m afraid I can’t describe it. It’s one of those things you have to experience for yourself, in person. The music showered upon me and I could feel there’s something big happening in front of me. It was a combination of this cosmic music and the whole stage moving and shimmering, everyone performing being in their own reveries, while at the same time where present to what they were playing. I sat there awe-struck. The music, the philosophy had a significant presence in the square. And the concert had it all - there were chaotic moments, as there were beautiful moments. It was complete, whole and perfect. The chanting in so many songs had a special quality too. There were moments when the band stepped down from stage and went through the audience, playing, singing, which was healing. It definitely was one of those concerts, when it’s done, something deep stays with you. My hour and a half drive back home through dark roads was something special. The music was with me.  </p>

<p>This is definitely something that is well worth experiencing in person - and you might get a chance, the Sun Ra Arkestra is pretty active. Check out <a href="http://www.sunraarkestra.com/">their website</a> to see when they’ll be around and go check them out. If you don’t, you can still listen to the enormous treasure of music that Sun Ra left us. Here’s a <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-05-30/music/the-sun-ra-guide/">really cool guide</a> that might help.</p>

<p>This was a personal post - I might write another one that’s more about Sun Ra, especially if there will be some interest.</p>

<p>Anyway, leave a comment and let me know what you think.</p>

    <h4 id="the-story-about-discovering-my-passion">The story about discovering my passion.</h4>
<p><img src="/img/2F-xOBj9x28df02FU7RhzavFqjI2FAAAAAAAABo42FsrzLXZOH9uE2Fs16002F63.jpg" alt="WALL-E" class="small" /></p>

<p>It has been too long. I haven’t written a post for over a year. I devoted all
my focus to other things in my life, but recently I found myself wanting to
start writing about music again. So here I am. I’ll write one post a week from
now on, so stay tuned. And please comment - feedback is always nice!</p>

<p>Since it’s been a while, I thought it would be appropriate to do something
slightly different. This one will be a personal story. It might be a silly
story, but it is actually quite important to me, so I’m going for it anyway. I
wanted to tell you the story of how I discovered Jazz (and the rest of the
music I listen to today).</p>

<p>It should be clear to anyone reading this blog that I’m really into music. To
me, it’s one of the finest things life has to offer. The music I listen to and
enjoy is something I identify myself with. It isn’t an overstatement to say
that it’s a part of who I am. But it hasn’t always been like this.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Without music, life would be a mistake.”― Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, it plays a big part of my everyday life. It probably does for most
people, I just tend to be quite ebullient and passionate about it (why do you
think I write a blog on it). It fills most of my time - music is around when I
work, study or relax. I love taking time off just to put on a good record, and
do nothing else at the same time. I get a kick out of reading books on music
and musicians. But in the end, it’s simply about the beauty, intricacies and
the sheer perfection of good music, that draws me so much.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I listen mostly to Jazz and Blues. Some years back, I actually
thought I didn’t like that kind of music and in a lot of ways I didn’t. I felt
like it’s not for me, because it’s too complicated and I would  never ‘get
it’. I’d be intrigued by it, but stopped myself, thinking you have to be a
musician or special kind of smart, to get it.</p>

<p>Then one day, I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/">WALL-E</a>.</p>

<p>In one scene near the beginning of the movie, a song inconspicuously started
playing. A lovely trickling piano sounded the room and then, the most
beautiful trumpet I’ve ever heard entered with gusto. I was still not aware of
an impact that this would have on me. Then, as the rich, coarse voice, full of
love and romance sang ‘Hold me close and hold me fast, the magic spell you
cast…’ I would start noticing something. I wouldn’t know what it was until
later, but I was moved. After it ended, the music left a profound presence in
the room. I was mesmerized. I kept asking myself “What was that song?”. As I’m
writing this, I’m aware of the absurdity to write down such significance to
WALL-E, but at that time, it was everything. Not the movie, but what it
brought to me. The movie ended, and I was still just asking myself that
question. I resorted to the the Internet gods, asking if they know what song
it was. I couldn’t find it, so eventually I went through the whole soundtrack,
until I came across the familiar sound.</p>

<p>La Vie En Rose.</p>

<p>Louis Armstrong.</p>

<p>Hm, I had heard of him. Well, I knew him to the extent of ‘What a Wonderful
World’. And I vaguely remembered a music class in elementary school, where we
mentioned him in relation to something about jazz. I was a bit surprised that
this was the man behind the song. Little did I know, that this song, and this
musical colossus will change my life. I Immediately looked for the song on
Youtube - I had to hear this magic again. And I did. I listened to it one more
time, then I started clicking through related songs. I carefully listened to
every song, savoring each note. With every single song, I was taken deeper
into the rabbit hole. It was like meeting someone for the first time, falling
for them, and then wondering where they’ve been your whole life. I never knew
I could feel such joy listening to music. Music like this was unknown to me
and I was swept away.</p>

<p>Thus began my journey to the wonderful music of Louis Armstrong and ultimately
to the world of Jazz, Blues and Soul. In the following weeks, I would continue
exploring Satchmo’s music and even after the initial excitement wore off,
there would be a song every now and then, that would stop me from what I was
doing, and just make me marvel at the beauty. To this day, Louis Armstrong is
my all-time favorite musician.</p>

<p>After falling so desperately in love with his music, I started doubting my
previous decision that Jazz is not for me. Suddenly I was drawn to it. Most of
it was still a sound I wasn’t used to, but I decided to start exploring it. I
watched a great documentary - Jazz, by Ken Burns, which in turn, introduced me
to many important figures of jazz history. I started listening to <a href="/2013/01/17/The-First-Lady-Of-Song/">Ella
Fitzgerald</a>, Duke Ellington, Clifford Brown, Fats Waller, <a href="/2013/01/17/Robert-Johnson/">Robert
Johnson</a> and many more. I relished their music. And with every new
artist, every song, every record, one thing became clearer and clearer. I
found my passion.</p>

<p>Back in October 2012, in <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/bobby-
mcferrin_12.html">my post about Bobby
McFerrin</a> I mentioned I attended a concert in New York, but never
talked more about it, so I wanted to do that now.<br />
Last September I went on a trip through New York, Washington and my beloved
New Orleans (you can check out the photos on <a href="http://zanderle.com/">my
website</a>). As was my wish for years, I wanted to see
where jazz was born. Just days before my departure to New York, I found that
Wynton Marsalis and JALC were performing with Bobby McFerrin. I had to double
check, because I could not believe my eyes. I was ecstatic. Two of my
favourite artists performing together?! What a way to start the trip that was
already meant to be all about music anyway.<br />
The venue - Lincoln Center in The Time Warner Center on the 60th street - was
so beautiful, sophisticated and classy. Some don’t care about that, but I
always appreciate a nice atmosphere at a concert. The concert’s theme was
Bobby McFerrin’s biography, but I felt that wasn’t exactly the main thing of
the night, it was more of a way to convey this great collaboration. I
mentioned Jazz at Lincoln Center in one of <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/eric-clapton-wynton-
marsalis-play-blues.html">my previous
posts</a> and they are truly amazing. It’s a band consisting
of only great musicians and I really enjoy their sound and like pretty much
anything they do. At the concert it felt like they could make anyone sound
awesome, let alone Bobby McFerrin. I am a great admirer of both Bobby McFerrin
and Wynton Marsalis, and this was probably one of the best concerts I’ve ever
been to. In hindsight I would, however, like to see Bobby do more of his usual
crazy stuff and Wynton solo more. But nevertheless, the concert was magical
just the way it was. The band and Bobby just clicked on so many levels and I
guess that’s the result of Bobby blending in more and not doing his usual
stuff to the fullest potential.<br />
I was so thankful to be able to listen to their rich sound in person. It was
so intense, I remember getting emotional and filled with such happiness
throughout the concert. Ah, I can’t wait the next time I’m going to hear
Wynton or Bobby live again.<br />
I highly recommend you listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcByeRvkBQ0">the whole
concert</a>, I believe it’s well
worth it. But if you don’t have the time, or are not interested, here are a
few excerpts.  </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=24m40s">Beautiful rendition</a> of George
Gershwin’s Prelude No. 2. It’s evident right away, how well they they go
together, Bobby and JALC.  </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=52m30s">Charlie Parker’s Donna Lee</a>, and the
only time at the concert where Wynton and Bobby directly interact with each
other. And it is golden! If you’ll listen to only one song, listen to this
one. Their duet always brings a smile on my face, it’s just soo good!!! I love
it.  </p>

<p>They performed this concerts a couple of nights in a row. I was there on the
opening night and the video on youtube is from one of the following nights.
There are minor differences, but there is also one major one. On the opening
night, there was Paul Simon in the audience and after the intermission, Mr
McFerrin called him up on stage to sing Scarborough Fair with him. At first he
was really reluctant and didn’t want to come up, and we all really thought he
wouldn’t. But after a lot of convincing from the audience, Paul came up.
That’s right. Paul freakin’ Simon! Just when I thought the night can’t get any
better… Needless to say, it was the highlight of the concert. Beautiful,
magical, mysterious and heartwarming.<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=1h50s">Here is</a> a version without Paul,
beautiful as well.  </p>

<p>And finally some crazy Bobby McFerrin stuff -
<a href="http://youtu.be/PcByeRvkBQ0?t=1h20m50s">here</a> he sings Beethoven’s 7th
Symphony. I know right, who on earth sings this?<br />
At the concert I attended, Bobby sang solo a capella version of Somewhere Over
the Rainbow for encore. Genius!<br />
I’ll say it again, I strongly recommend you take an hour and forty minutes for
yourself and enjoy this beautiful performance. I think Bobby McFerrin and
Wynton Marsalis have some special energy between them and you can hear it
firsthand.<br />
It’s actually one of my wishes, that they record an album together. They’re
just so amazing together. Listen to a song they recorded together on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CNQNU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0001CNQNU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">one of Wynton’s albums</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0001CNQNU" alt="" /> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLD8i8CMw14">Baby, I Love You</a>. The kind of chemistry they
have is simply infectious.  </p>

<p>What about you, what do you think? Thoughts on the concert, Bobby, Wynton,
JALC, the post? As I always, I encourage you to share your comments.  </p>

<p>Until next time everyone.</p>

<p>I’m finally writing about a band that’s not only still active but also
Slovenian! Isn’t that something? But seriously, I’m actually really happy to
be writing about someone I personally know for a change. Two of my good
friends are in a somewhat obscure Slovenian band, called Salonski. Two months
ago they released their debut album ‘Fauna’ which made me take on this post.
At first I was a bit unsure how to go about it - should I try to be as
objective as possible or not? In the end I decided I’m just going to write
what I think and not worry about being biased (which I know I will be).</p>

<p>The band went through a lot of member changes through the years, but currently
consists of Domen Finžgar (accordion, vocals), Ines Vodopija (piano), Jana
Arlič (violin), Larisa Petrič (violin), Miha Hafner (french horn), Miha
Poredoš (ukulele) and Žiga Barba (trombone).</p>

<p>Domen, who is the leader and the driving force of the band, never fails to
amaze me. It seems creativity is oozing out of his every pore. Besides being a
musician, he’s a composer (the whole album is composed by him), a great comic
author and a game designer. On top of his constant artistic outputs, he’s also
a hard working student of Forestry at University in Ljubljana. The variety of
his interests shows that he has countless ideas and that he doesn’t want to be
bound to just one way of sharing them. And it’s not just the sheer number of
the projects he takes on, it’s the eagerness and confidence with which he
executes them, that is impressive. Fauna, of course, is no exception. Check
out his <a href="http://finzgar.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>, to see and follow his other
projects.</p>

<p>He managed to put together a great band, without which he wouldn’t be able to
get his point across quite as powerfully. All of them are actually an
inspiration to me - everytime I listen to the album I can’t believe that this
unique piece of music was created by a group of students for whom music is
just something they do on the side.</p>

<p>You can listen to Fauna on this <a href="http://salonski.bandcamp.com/">link</a>, where
you can also purchase it.</p>

<p>From the first time I heard they’re recording an album, I could hardly wait
for it and then, when I could finally give it a listen, I was thoroughly
impressed. From the first few seconds of the album, when Domen’s accordion
warmly backs his vocals, I was already digging it and after the whole band
joins in, I knew I was in for something great. I’m glad to say, I wasn’t
mistaken.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-gE1UCtp2d2c2FUdm8wIkPMzI2FAAAAAAAABZQ2FH3ad8Cy2ljI2Fs16002F16213_446663092085578_778926986_n.jpg" alt="Photo by Sabina Pirnat" class="right breathe" /></p>

<p>The album is truly amazing. Its genres range from folk, etno, doo wop to rap,
cajun and tango, while its inspirations reach even broader. It’s very easy to
listen to and its strongest point, I believe, is that it is so incredibly
comforting. Not everything is executed with perfection and some parts are
modest, but through that it shows the honesty and unpretentiousness of the
whole band. They love what they’re doing and they play from their heart, which
always shines through. The great, unusual instrument selection gives the album
its warm sound. And I must say, no drums is a welcome change from what we’re
used to hearing every day. The melodies are earthy and the phrases are often
simple, but never boring or predictable. Finžgar’s vocals are raw and somewhat
unpolished but sincere, absolutely convincing and warm.</p>

<p>As I’ve said, the range of inspirations is vast and impressive. I love how
Domen in his songs takes a piece of an inspiration, blatantly uses it, but
adds his own perspective and makes it completely his own. He really has a
knack for combining all kinds of genres.</p>

<p>He says that for most compositions he originates from his accordion playing
and draws from there. This makes accordion central part of Fauna, which is
just great, since Domen knows how to squeeze all the good juices out of his
instrument and bring out the best in it. Other instruments at times sound like
extensions or assets to his own playing, and it sounds perfect - listen to
Shruti Box and Early Riser. For the other part they provide a reliable
background and simply weave the fabric of music, which, in essence, makes this
album what it is.</p>

<p>The first song, ‘Ljubezen delala’ was where Domen tried interpreting the songs
differently for the first time (which is why it was chosen to be the first
track). He combined ‘She thinks I still Care’ and a song he and Žiga heard in
Slovenian countryside, performed by a random stranger. Please listen to ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owWNCNyEuYI">She
thinks I still Care</a>’, just to
hear how skillfully it’s crafted into ‘Ljubezen delala’.</p>

<p>I wanted to just mention the next song, ‘Tango za mentalno mrtve’ (Tango for
the mentally dead), because of the source of the lyrics. They borrowed it from
song by Gravediggaz, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vLiJIgVlRQ">1-800
Suicide</a> (2:45). When you go
through the whole album and search for all the different inspirations it’s
amazing to think how they pulled it off. Gravediggaz is just one example.</p>

<p>And my two favourite songs (well technically, three) on the album are ‘V
Calgaryu ni letališča’ and ‘Shruti Box’ with ‘Early Riser’. The first one’s
lyrics are really touching and strong and the whole song is in sync with that.
I’m touched every time I listen to it. ‘Shruti Box’ + ‘Early Riser’ on the
other hand, are just great to listen to. I appreciate the development or the
storytelling aspect to it.</p>

<p>At this point, I’d like to apologize to all my english speaking readers, since
some lyrics are in slovene and I’m not translating them. I hope this won’t
deter you from listening to the album.</p>

<p>I’ll finish the post here, since I don’t want it to go on for too long. I am
considering writing another one about Fauna, going more into the specific
songs and talking about the genius usage and blend of different inspirations
in them. I’m not sure though, we’ll see.</p>

<p>Your comments are, as always, much appreciated. Until next time.</p>

    <p><img src="/img/2Fwp-content2Fuploads2F20112F042FBen-Harper-There-will-be-a-light.jpeg" alt="" />
Two months ago I began making some decisions about my
studies and consequently I was focusing on college and neglected my blog and
photography. I’ve simply put it on hold. I thought I didn’t miss it that much,
but then, a couple of days ago, I was reading one of my older posts. It made
me remember why I started writing in the first place. I mean I enjoy just
listening to music, but writing about it gives me something more. It makes me
more aware of how passionate I actually am about music and I love that
feeling. So here I am again, writing after a (too) long break. For the past
few weeks I’ve also started doing something new - I committed to listening 2
new albums every week, which means I definitely won’t run out of stuff to
write about.</p>

<p>Enough about that, let me talk about what I’m here to talk about. In 2004 Ben
Harper and the Blind Boys of Alabama recorded an album called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDIE7Y/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDIE7Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">There Will Be A Light</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000TDIE7Y" alt="" />. It is one of my
favourite albums of all time and one of the best collaboration albums I know.
I’ve always been completely blown away by good collaborations. It’s simply
beyond me how two groups are able to melt into one so completely so that they
don’t sound like two separate groups, while at the same time, retain and show
what each makes them unique. And it all fits together perfectly! It’s nothing
short of magical. The reason I’m bringing this up is because the way Ben
Harper and the Blind Boys Of Alabama work together on these 11 songs is an
epitome of what I’m trying to say.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fserve2F_2F297629192FBen2BHarper2BAnd2BThe2BBlind2BBoys2BOf2BAlabama.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before I listened to this album, I knew Ben Harper’s music as quite eclectic,
but the part I was interested in was a mixture of indie, rock, folk and maybe
blues, with most of his songs being introspective and somewhat melancholic.
Which I love. Here are a few great songs, so you can hear what I mean.</p>

<p>The Blind Boys of Alabama is a gospel
group that’s been active for well over 70 years now and they’re one of the
best in their field. And if you’re wondering, yes, they’re actually blind
(apart from one member I believe). They were performing in Ljubljana a couple
of years ago and I really regret not seeing them - at that time I had no idea
who they are. Now I can’t think of any other group that would make this album
as powerful as it is now.</p>

<p>Seven of the songs on the album are written by Ben, specifically for this
occasion. The rest are traditional gospel tunes and covers (keep an eye on Bob
Dylan’s Well, Well, Well). The moment I heard the first song of the album,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FALuWDPOLdg">Take My Hand</a>, I knew I was in
for a treat. What an understatement that proved to be. The album is just that
good!</p>

<p>The Blind Boys of Alabama create a basis on which Ben flourishes. They provide
a background that’s rich, joyful and full of faith to his emotional, honest
and heartwarming singing. Add to that a great instrumental accompaniment and
you get this incredible piece of music. Here are, in my opinion, the
highlights of the album:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fimages2Fstories2Fmarch20032Fapril20102Fmay20102Fjune20102Fblind2520boys2520of2520alabama252001.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The title song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-lHWmpVxzk">There Will Be a
Light</a>. No words needed here. Just
listen and feel it.</p>

<p>Powerful rendition of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPn8ivGUVG0">Well, Well,
Well</a> with some crazy guitar work
on 11th commandment before that.</p>

<p>The a cappella song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca1vnGfIWVo">If I Could Hear My Mother Pray
Again</a>, is simply haunting. It’s
amazing that a human voice without any instruments to back it up is capable of
creating such an emotional work of art. Probably my favourite song of the
album - the Blind Boys Of Alabama at their best, if you ask me.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you love it as much as I do? Do you agree that their
collaboration on this album is perfect?</p>

<p>Until next time…</p>

<p>P.S. Does anyone have any requests for what you would like to see me write
about next time?</p>

<p>Next up in this women in jazz series is the magnificent Ella Fitzgerald. I
feel a bit intimidated writing about her - she was just that good! Her voice
is probably as pure as it gets. It’s bright, perfectly clear and it’s very
comforting. Her singing is so effortless that she makes it seem like it’s easy
to sing like that. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to have Ella for
a grandma. Whenever someone felt blue, she would just sing their troubles
away. While I love <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a> and <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, they never make me feel as good as Ella always does. It’s
easy to get caught up in her music and forget about your worries.</p>

<p>I got to know Ella through my love of Louis Armstrong. As you may know, Lady
Ella and Satchmo recorded 3 albums together, all of which are simply golden.
Some people refer to ‘Porgy and Bess’ album as “Sandpaper and whipped cream”.
I personally prefer the first two albums - ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RD5E/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00004RD5E">Ella &amp; Louis</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00004RD5E" alt="" />’
and ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084H9J/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000084H9J">Ella andLouis Again</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000084H9J" alt="" />’
. A combination of her singing and her exquisite voice, his amazing trumpet playing and his raspy
voice is entrancing. Listen to ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmoiGZuiFQ">They Can’t Take That Away From
Me</a>’ or ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtG9CnMtzZk">Learning The
Blues</a>’ to get a feeling of what
I’m talking about. And even if you’re not interested in what I’m talking
about, just listen to the songs because it’s wonderful music and also because
these albums are probably an example of one of the best collaborations ever.<br />
For some other Ella Fitzgerald’s albums, I would recommend ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000479L/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000479L">Intimate Ella</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00000479L" alt="" />’ or
some of her songbooks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKYZK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0034JKYZK">Cole Porter’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0034JKYZK" alt="" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000006P6L/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000006P6L">Gershwin’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000006P6L" alt="" /> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LOYS8Y/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001LOYS8Y">Duke 
Ellington’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001LOYS8Y" alt="" />. The first two are
actually not even that jazzy, so they might be especially appropriate for
someone who’s not that into jazz, but because of Ella’s amazing vocals they
will also be liked by jazz fans. ‘Intimate Ella’ is a good one to get the most
out of her voice, since she’s accompanied only by a piano on this one. Here’s
an example.</p>

<p>I read about her life the other day and I was quite surprised. Ella was born
and brought up in poverty and she was actually homeless for a year before
starting her career. She hit her big break at a talent show in Harlem. She was
supposed to dance, but after seeing an amazing dance act go on before her, she
got scared and at the last second decided to sing instead. Best last second
decision ever!<br />
Behind the stage, she was actually shy and reserved, which I think no one
would guess because she looked so confident and, in her own words, felt at
home on the stage. Singing is what she lived for. She often felt self-
conscious about her looks and at times even doubted her abilities. How can
someone so talented doubt themselves?! I guess she was still only a human,
like the rest of us, even though she sounded otherworldly.</p>

<p>What is your favourite Ella Fitzgerald album or song? Your thoughts are
appreciated.</p>

<p>Today, my two greatest passions in music are definitely Jazz and Blues. But it
wasn’t always so and there are two musicians who got me interested in this
music and ushered me to a whole new musical world - just as Louis Armstrong
kindled my passion for jazz, Robert Johnson did so with the blues.<br />
The first time I heard his music, I was blown away. I only heard one song and
already knew that this is what I’ve been looking for. I was mesmerized by the
raw emotion conveyed within the song. I haven’t heard anything quite like it
before. The singing, the guitar… it was all so powerful. And the reason I
can remember all of this so clearly is because nothing has changed - the
moment I put on Robert Johnson, I feel exactly like I did the first time I
heard him. The only difference is, that with every listening, I hear more and
more nuances in his music. Listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4up4VP8zjyc">Come On In My
Kitchen</a> and how he plays melody
and rhythm at the same time on his guitar, and all the while he delivers this
amazing singing, like it’s not even a big deal. Or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It-tJ8DOjIk">Terraplane
Blues</a>, where it almost sounds
like there’s more than one guitar playing (it’s all just him, fyi). But maybe
don’t even listen to that, just listen to the emotion and the feeling of the
songs. You don’t need to know anything about music for this to blow you away,
just be open to it. Huh, I get excited about Robert Johnson, I need to calm
down.<br />
So who is Robert Johnson? Let’s put on a song first, before we get started.</p>

<p>Of all the bluesmen, Robert Johnson’s life is probably the one shrouded in
mystery the most. Robert Leroy Johnson was born in 1911, in a small town
Hazlehurst, Mississippi. He developed an affection for music as a teenager and
started playing a harmonica. When he was around 19, he took interest in guitar
and started playing that instead. Around the same time, his wife died in
childbirth, which made him turn to his music that much more. He was learning
from any source he could get his hands on, and it was obvious that he was
still just learning. His most important mentor and source of inspiration was a
bluesman, Ike Zinnerman. It’s been told that they were playing their guitars
late every night in graveyards on tombstones, where no one would bother them.
If he wasn’t with Ike, Robert would go to the woods by himself, where he was
trying to learn everything he could about the guitar. After a couple of years
he started travelling around the state to play around different juke joints.
The musicians that had heard him when he was still just learning, were amazed.
They could not believe what kind of progress he made and how his abilities
suddenly surpassed their own.<br />
Because of his talent and because he played all the time and everywhere, he
quickly became famous around those parts. He played with many musicians and he
left a mark on most of them. He played in places, where they requested all
kinds of different songs, so he developed an amazing ability, where he had to
hear a song only once before he was able to play it. He could be deep in a
debate with a friend, with music playing in the background, and without ever
stopping the conversation, he could play and sing the song perfectly
afterwards. That helped him with a well-rounded repertoire for his gigs.</p>

<p>Robert had a big appetite for women, and women were crazy about him. He had a
habit of finding a woman in any town he went to, who would give him food,
money and a place to stay. His lust eventually killed him. One time, while
playing in a bar, he was flirting with a woman for the whole night. What he
didn’t realize, was that it was the owner’s wife. The owner was furious to see
this, so he put poison in young Robert’s drink, which killed him.</p>

<p>That’s one way of telling the story. The other (which makes much more sense,
if you ask me) goes like this: an aspiring young musician wants to become
famous and is willing to do anything for it. He tries really hard but his
desire is greater than his patience. One day he finds out, that if he goes to
a certain crossroad at midnight, he’ll meet someone who can help him. And
that’s exactly what he does. At the crossroads he meets a tall dark man, who
tunes his guitar, plays a song or two, and gives it back to him. And with
that, the deal is struck - Mr Johnson sells his soul to the Devil, in exchange
for the incredible musical abilities and renown. He goes back to the musicians
that taught him to play and surprises everyone with his skills. He’s
unbeatable. But there was another part to the deal - a couple of years later
the Devil gets his toll. Robert Johnson gets killed by the age of 27.</p>

<p>No matter what story you believe in, Robert Johnson’s music is simply amazing
and incredibly influential. Apart from some testimonies about his life, 3
photos of him and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OFWLO0/r
ef=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;cre
ative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004OFWLO0">29 songs</a><img src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004OFWLO0" alt="" /> (with alternate
takes it adds up to 41 recordings) are all we are left with. Thankfully, the
depth of his music makes that plenty.</p>

<p>Robert Johnson is my favourite bluesman of all times, so I wanted the post
about him to be really good. Otherwise I would feel I’m not doing him justice
(and even now I’m nervous because I want to make sure that doesn’t happen).
Therefore, I’m doing it in two stages, with this post serving as an
introduction to the post I’ll do in a couple of days.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brian Jones had the first album, and that’s where I first heard it. I’d just
met Brian, and I went around to his apartment-crash pad, actually, all he had
in it was a chair, a record player, and a few records. One of which was Robert
Johnson. He put it on, and it was just-you know-astounding stuff. When I first
heard it, I said to Brian, “Who’s that?” “Robert Johnson”. I said, “Yeah, but
who’s the other guy playing with him?” Because I was hearing two guitars, and
it took me a long time to realize he was actually doing it all by himself.<br />
I’ve never heard anybody before or since use the form and bend it quite so
much to make it work for himself. The quality of the songs themselves-I mean,
he came out with such compelling themes, they were actual songs as well as
just being the blues. The songs and the subject matter, just the way they were
treated, apart from the music and the performance. And the guitar playing-it
was almost like listening to Bach. You know, you think you’re getting a handle
on playing the blues, and then you hear Robert Johnson-some of the rhythms
he’s doing and playing and singing at the same time, you think, “This guy must
have three brains!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>To me Robert Johnson’s influence-he was like a comet or a meteor that came
along and, BOOM, suddenly he raised the ante, suddenly you just had to aim
that much higher. You can put the record on now, and it’s as fresh and
interesting as the first day you heard it. Everybody should know about Robert
Johnson. When you know about something, and comperatively few other people
know about it, that’s a crime in a way; you’ve got to do what you can to tell
people, “Hey, check this cat out. Because you’re in for something extra in
your life.” You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>by Keith Richards</em></p>

<p>Come back in a couple of days - you’re in for something extra in your life,
as Keith put it. Since it’s Robert Johnson, I couldn’t agree more.</p>

<p>Solomon Burke, also known as the king of Rock’ n’ Soul,  was a phenomenal
singer full of energy, one of the pioneers of Soul music and also an
overlooked musical talent. For most people the name won’t ring any bells, but
I’m sure a lot of you know him even though you don’t realize. Some people
might know him through <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbK5tgjA38">The</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbK5tgjA38">
Rolling Stones</a>, who covered his
‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OKAlBC-
XWQ">Everybody Needs Somebody To Love</a>’, or maybe through the movie Blues Brothers which also contains this
song, others will know him through the Dirty Dancing soundtrack and ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEu8DrO9PbY">Cry To
me</a>’ and some might have seen him
on <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/solomon-burke-20101202">Rolling Stone list of Top 100 singers of all
time</a>. But whether you know him or not, he’ll
always be one of the greatest Soul singers of all time.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of his music and his rich singing. I think it embodies exactly
the things I love about Soul music. I love how he can sing either gently and
slowly or enthusiastically and with so much force it could satisfy any kind of
audience. But either way, his singing is always powerful and full of emotion
and intricacies. I’ve been listening to his music for many years now, and at
the end of 2009, I saw that he was doing a tour around Europe. I was looking
at the tickets for the shows near Slovenia, but ultimately, I said to myself
“ah, I can’t do it this time, I’m sure he’ll be back again and I’ll go then”.
Well, in 2010 he passed away and to this day not seeing him live is still one
of the greatest regrets I’ve ever had. Today I enjoy his music more than ever,
but the way I decided not to see him there and then is on my mind whenever I
listen to him.</p>

<p>You can easily find his big songs from the 60’s on one of different <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000346M/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythou

compilations (which is definitely worth having) but if there’s one album I
would recommend to anyone, it has to be <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B000068CTE/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC

amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000068CTE" alt="" />. I feel like even
people who don’t enjoy this kind of music will like it. I absolutely love this
album and it’s one of my favourite albums ever. I like how it’s so fresh every
time I listen to it. For example, I listened to it two days ago (after
listening to it many times before, of course) and hearing it today, it feels
like I’ve heard it for the first time again. It was recorded in 2002 and it
was a great comeback for Solomon and also a great comeback for old style Soul
music. He proved that he hasn’t lost any of the energy he had in his prime
era. Some great songwriters wrote all of the songs for this album,
specifically for Solomon. All of them are great fans of his and some of these
songwriters are Bob Dylan, Nick Lowe, Brian Wilson (from the Beach Boys), Van
Morrison, Tom Waits and Elvis Costello. Listen to this great song to either
get a feeling of the album or to just hear an amazing song and an amazing
vocalist.</p>

<p>Do you like it? What do you think? As always, I would love to hear your
thoughts on the matter.</p>

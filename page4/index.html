<p>Solomon Burke, also known as the king of Rock’ n’ Soul,  was a phenomenal
singer full of energy, one of the pioneers of Soul music and also an
overlooked musical talent. For most people the name won’t ring any bells, but
I’m sure a lot of you know him even though you don’t realize. Some people
might know him through <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbK5tgjA38">The</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbK5tgjA38">
Rolling Stones</a>, who covered his
‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OKAlBC-
XWQ">Everybody Needs Somebody To Love</a>’, or maybe through the movie Blues Brothers which also contains this
song, others will know him through the Dirty Dancing soundtrack and ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEu8DrO9PbY">Cry To
me</a>’ and some might have seen him
on <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/solomon-burke-20101202">Rolling Stone list of Top 100 singers of all
time</a>. But whether you know him or not, he’ll
always be one of the greatest Soul singers of all time.  </p>

<p>I’m a big fan of his music and his rich singing. I think it embodies exactly
the things I love about Soul music. I love how he can sing either gently and
slowly or enthusiastically and with so much force it could satisfy any kind of
audience. But either way, his singing is always powerful and full of emotion
and intricacies. I’ve been listening to his music for many years now, and at
the end of 2009, I saw that he was doing a tour around Europe. I was looking
at the tickets for the shows near Slovenia, but ultimately, I said to myself
“ah, I can’t do it this time, I’m sure he’ll be back again and I’ll go then”.
Well, in 2010 he passed away and to this day not seeing him live is still one
of the greatest regrets I’ve ever had. Today I enjoy his music more than ever,
but the way I decided not to see him there and then is on my mind whenever I
listen to him.  </p>

<p>You can easily find his big songs from the 60’s on one of different <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000346M/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythou

compilations (which is definitely worth having) but if there’s one album I
would recommend to anyone, it has to be <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B000068CTE/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC

amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000068CTE" alt="" />. I feel like even
people who don’t enjoy this kind of music will like it. I absolutely love this
album and it’s one of my favourite albums ever. I like how it’s so fresh every
time I listen to it. For example, I listened to it two days ago (after
listening to it many times before, of course) and hearing it today, it feels
like I’ve heard it for the first time again. It was recorded in 2002 and it
was a great comeback for Solomon and also a great comeback for old style Soul
music. He proved that he hasn’t lost any of the energy he had in his prime
era. Some great songwriters wrote all of the songs for this album,
specifically for Solomon. All of them are great fans of his and some of these
songwriters are Bob Dylan, Nick Lowe, Brian Wilson (from the Beach Boys), Van
Morrison, Tom Waits and Elvis Costello. Listen to this great song to either
get a feeling of the album or to just hear an amazing song and an amazing
vocalist.  </p>

<p>Do you like it? What do you think? As always, I would love to hear your
thoughts on the matter.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, I watched a movie about an amazing American songwriter
Cole Porter, called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352277/">De-Lovely</a>. To
anyone who’s never heard of Cole Porter before: he was a prolific composer,
famous for his Broadway shows and his numerous jazz standards. He was
something special for writing both lyrics and music for his songs, which was a
rarity at that time. He had an amazing ability to come up with genius, funny,
witty lyrics, often full of innuendos, always accompanied by beautiful
melodies. Anybody, who was ever somebody in Jazz, recorded songs by Cole
Porter at one point or another in their career - from <a href="/2013/01/17/The-First-Lady-Of-Song/">Ella
Fitzgerald</a>, Louis Armstrong, <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a> to Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Oscar Peterson and many others.
And to anyone familiar with Cole: even if you’re only remotely interested in
Mr Porter, this is a movie you cannot miss! After watching the movie, I
started understanding his songs much better and I started noticing more
important details in his music and intricate lyrics.<br />
The movie starts at the end of Cole Porter’s life, with the dying songwriter
retrospecting on his life, but observing it as if it was a musical. It’s a
great concept that fits perfectly to his life and music. The story talks about
his life, his indulgence and his very interesting relationship with his wife,
Linda. It features great performances by Robbie Williams, Alanis Morissette,
Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Natalie Cole and others. It’s truly
a great biopic, which reveals new dimensions to the irreplaceable Cole Porter.
The only criticism I have is that the movie starts and ends with a great
rhythm, but somewhere in the middle seems to slow down a bit, which makes it
feel a bit inconsistent. But seeing as how great the movie is overall, this is
hardly an important remark.<br />
I highly recommend the movie to anyone interested in music or anyone simply
looking for a good story. In case you like it, I suggest you get Ella
Fitzgerald’s <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B0034JKYZK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC

to listen to afterwards. Her renditions are simply beautiful and it’s a great way to start
getting into Cole’s music.<br />
Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY/ref=as_li_tf_t

as soon as possible. You won’t be sorry. Enjoy and come back afterwards to tell me what
you thought! I’d love to hear your comments.  </p>

<p>Ugh, I haven’t posted in almost two weeks now, it’s almost like I slept
through the holidays. Anyway I’m back now, so let’s get right to it.  </p>

<p>Roberta Flack, there’s an amazing singer! I’m not sure why I haven’t written
about her in <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/search/label/Women">my women in jazz
series</a>, but I’m
making up for it now. I was introduced to her music by a good friend last year
and I’m still grateful.<br />
Roberta Flack is a singer and a songwriter, born in 1939 and most notably
known for her hits in the 70’s. If you’ve never heard of her, you probably
know her by her famous “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1eOsMc2Fgg">Killing Me Softly With His
Song</a>”, which won her a Grammy in
1974. Another quite renowned song she recorded is “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOFrGbuUqnQ">The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face</a>”.<br />
I don’t care too much for either of these songs and I’m not sure why. I guess
they just don’t move me. But I do love and respect Roberta and the reason for
that is her first three albums - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product
/B000002J5S/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=178
9&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000002J5S">First Take</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000002J5S" alt="" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002I60/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000002I60">Chapter Two</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000002I60" alt="" />
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KRTA4G/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004KRTA4G">Quiet Fire</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004KRTA4G" alt="" />
. They’re soft, sophisticated and soulful. In life in general, I appreciate things that slowly
build up to their peak, may that be in music, movies, books, shows or food. I
feel that if something builds up to its full intensity gradually, it’s much
more powerful than it would be, if it was as forceful from the very beginning.
And I’m saying this, because I think songs in these albums provide just that -
a wonderful slow build-up. That, of course, doesn’t mean there’s not much
happening, it means they’re really powerful and strong.<br />
Her music on these albums is like the ocean waves hitting the shore - at first
glance it seems slow, quiet and serene but in reality it has so much power and
energy.<br />
These three albums are amazing and I highly recommend them. Here are two songs
to get a feeling of what kind of music to expect.  </p>

<p>Roberta is still creating new music. Just last year she recorded an album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00687XM22/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00687XM22">Let
It Be Roberta: Roberta Flack Sings The Beatles</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00687XM22" alt="" />
. I really like The Beatles and I used to be obsessed with them so when I saw that she made an
album full of their songs I was excited. As soon as I started listening to the
album, the excitement was replaced with disappointment. With the exception of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ZqvbQw-YY&amp;feature=youtu.be">one song</a>, it’s
an awful album (at least to my ears anyway). You know, how sometimes older
people try to sound young and hip but they end up just sounding awkward? Well
that’s how I feel about this album. It sounds like she did some stuff on it
just because “it’s what young people listen to these days”, instead of doing
her own thing. For the better part of the album I was shaking my head, and
asking myself “why?”. As much as I enjoy Roberta’s early music, this is one
album I probably won’t listen to again.  </p>

<p>What do you think? Do you have a Roberta Flack favourite? As always, I really
appreciate any kind of comments.</p>

<p>After talking about <a href="/2012/11/03/Sam-Cooke/">Sam
Cooke</a> and
<a href="/2013/01/11/Don't-Give-Up-On-Me/">Solomon Burke</a>, here’s another Soul giant. Otis Redding was one of the
pioneers of Soul music and was truly amazing. He had a signature raspy voice
and amazing ability to convey raw emotion. There are three words that apply
perfectly to what Otis was all about: Passion, Energy and Emotion. He’s
considered to be one of the greatest singers of all time and his singing style
influenced many singers. To name only a few - Al Green, Joe Cocker, Bill
Withers, Janis Joplin, Van Morrison and many others. In fact he’s number 8 on<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202">

time-19691231/otis-redding-20101202">Rolling Stone Magazine’s Top 100
Singers</a> of all time. He was also highly respected
by The Rolling Stones, who covered his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW-TtMKBCh4">That’s How Strong My Love
Is</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puydDR7gRmU">Pain In My
Heart</a> and in return he covered
their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmnZRBTPzg0">(I Can’t Get No)
Satisfaction</a>. So anyway, if you
know who he was, you know exactly what I’m talking about and if you don’t,
then please, read on, because you’re missing out.<br />
Otis Redding’s first big hit was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqVrNK4uiB4">These Arms Of
Mine</a> but the hits really started
flying about three years later, when he recorded stuff like Mr Pitiful, I’ve
Been Loving You Too Long, I Can’t Turn You Loose, Satisfaction, Respect (out
of which Aretha Franklin later made a huge hit), Shake and others. He mostly
sang just ballads and party tunes and I’m not a big fan of the latter. I mean,
don’t get me wrong, it’s all great stuff, this is just me being very picky.
What I don’t like about those tunes (like
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohkFgdCE2yQ">Shake</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZxN9iQM7OY">Hard To
Handle</a>…) is that they sound
quite simple, they’re done in the same brassy style every time, so after a
while it all sounds a bit repetitive. It wasn’t like this by chance of course,
it was simply because Otis really appreciated the beauty in simplicity. On the
other hand, I’m crazy about his ballads. Songs like Pain In My Heart, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmLjbTBcdU">Try A
Little Tenderness</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJUWn-26jkw">Amen
</a>and others are just too good to
pass on. To me, songs like these showcase his singing and his abilities to
convey emotions powerfully. Listen to Pain in My Heart and listen to how he
sings ‘Love me’ or ‘Come back’. It’s so compelling.  </p>

<p>In 1967, he recorded (Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay. At the time he was
already very successful and he was already considered to be a great singer,
musician and a song-writer but this song took all of that to a whole new
level. It was a breakthrough for him as a musician and it pointed to new
heights that his music might go to. But, just days after it was recorded, one
of the biggest tragedies in the music history happened when he died in a plane
crash. He was 26. I’ll leave you with the song and the enticing question “What
if”.  </p>

<p>P.S. I wrote this post after a friend requested it. If anyone else has any
requests, I would love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Here’s a follow-up on the post I did a few days ago. This time around, I’ll
mention a few Christmas albums that are a bit different from the usual stuff.
A kind of change that is very welcomed among Christmas music, that otherwise
sounds the same most of the time.  </p>

<p>First off, it’s the Godfather of Soul - James Brown and his album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001EFD/ref=as_li
_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creat
iveASIN=B000001EFD">James
Brown’s Funky Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000001EFD" alt="" />.
The title pretty
much sums it up and it’s quite an unusual combination, at least for my ears,
but that doesn’t mean it’s not good. If you ask me, it’s actually great. There
are a few misses along the way, but overall it’s a great Christmas album, with
amazing, powerful, <img class="right" src="http://www.funkmysoul.gr/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/james-brown-funky-christmas-300x300.jpg" /> energetic James’ singing. I
definitely recommend it, if you’re in the mood for something different. Listen
to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2GD8nQDxeE">Sweet Little Baby Boy</a> or<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUabyfwVDuI">
Let’s Make Christmas Mean Something This
Year</a> to get a taste of it. Do you
know the song Please Come Home For Christmas? Here’s James Brown’s surprising
rendition. It’s very different from other versions which is exactly why I love
it.  </p>

<p><a href="/2013/01/17/The-First-Lady-Of-Song/">The First Lady of TheSong</a>
recorded Christmas albums too. And good thing she did. Listen to
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WL1Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006WL1Q">Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006WL1Q" alt="" />
to hear how classic
Christmas songs were supposed to be sung. Here’s my favourite on the album,
‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkjz-
6nic8">What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?</a>’.  </p>

<p>Last, but not least is one of my favourite musicians of all time,<a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/08/rainy-night-in-
georgia.html"> Ray
Charles</a>. In 1985, he recorded <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B002D3I1TO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC
ode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002D3I1TO">The Spirit of Christmas</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002D3I1TO" alt="" />. Before this year,
<img class="small" src="http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/ella-fitzgerald.jpeg" />
I didn’t even know he recorded a Christmas album. I think I know, which album
I’ll have on repeat this Christmas. The warm, soulful sounds Ray managed to
create time and again, fit perfectly with the Christmas spirit and the result
can be heard on this album. I wouldn’t listen to this album outside the
Christmas season though, for it sounds cheesy at times. But since it is
Christmas, I love it!  </p>

<p>Here’s my favourite on the album, ‘<a href="http://youtu.be/EEeTnZuVcB0?t=4m8s">All I Want For
Christmas</a>’, and don’t let the title scare
you, it’s not Mariah Carey…  </p>

<p>What are your favourites? What do you think of my humble selection? Comments
from anyone are, as always, welcome.<br />
Next time, since a good friend requested it, it’s Otis Redding (if anyone else
has any requests, you should never hesitate!). I’m Looking forward to this
one! I’ll leave you off with a great song, which connects this post and the
next.  </p>

<p>For some reason, I’m really afraid of writing about instrumental music. Even
though I really want to, basically all my posts so far have been about music
that includes a singer. After confiding in <a href="http://mitrovic.co/blog/">my
friend</a> about this fear, he made a great suggestion:
we would tell each other which instrumental album to write about on our next
blog post, and just do it. It was exactly the kind of motivation I needed. So
here I am, nervous and afraid, writing my very first post about a piece of
solely instrumental music.</p>

<p>The album my friend chose for me is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006GO9Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00006GO9Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">In a Silent Way</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006GO9Q" alt="" /> by Miles Davis. I
usually talk about the artist for a little bit, but if I wanted to talk about
Miles, one whole post probably wouldn’t suffice, so I’ll make it extra brief.
Miles Davis, born in 1926, was a jazz trumpeter and one of the most
influential musicians in the 20th century. For 50 years, he basically kept
inventing new genres and explored jazz in so many new directions (Bebop, Hard
bop, Modal jazz, Fusion, Cool jazz). It’s safe to say that jazz today wouldn’t
be where it is without him. If you don’t know who he is, you might want to
read something about him, as he is one of the most important figures of the
20th century music. Or better yet, listen to some of his classic albums -
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmaQdPoWVGM">Kind Of Blue</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sVapY6JDu8">‘Round About
Midnight</a> or
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38bShXrS7pM">Milestones</a>. Keep in mind though,
that that is only a tiny part of his musical career - what he’s created over
the years ranges far beyond these three albums.</p>

<p>When I first started listening to
jazz and heard about Miles Davis, I just didn’t get it why he’s supposed to be
so good. Sure, I liked Kind Of Blue, but that’s about it. It was making me
kind of annoyed, that everyone was praising him so much. I thought he was
overrated and was frustrated that no one else saw that. Even with this
opinion, I didn’t think his early stuff was bad or anything, whereas the weird
fusion thingy, I just couldn’t take. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7mHNEA7z2U">weird
appearance</a> on stage didn’t help
with that. So, very early on, I decided that I don’t really care for Miles
Davis and that I hate jazz fusion.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2F-B1a2Tm9SnFk2FUWctVDOlvKI2FAAAAAAAABTY2F-svjWC-iVoo2Fs16002Fmiles-davis-by-jan-persson.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Four years of listening to jazz (but avoiding Miles and anything similar)
later, I suddenly found myself getting more and more interested in Bebop,
Avant-Garde, Modern jazz, all the stuff I thought I didn’t like. Just like
that, Miles’ music eventually crept back to me after all that time. I gave the
albums I knew, another listen and was surprised that this was the same music
as the kind I used to dislike. It sounded differently. I loved it! There were
so many beautiful things happening in the music and I couldn’t understand how
I couldn’t hear that before. Even though I had evidence against me, I kept my
skepticism against Miles.</p>

<p>So when my friend asked me to write about Miles Davis’ album, you can imagine
how I was unsure about that. I thought to myself “how on earth am I going to
write about this?? I’m probably not even going to like it”. Nevertheless, I
decided that, for once in my life, I’ll get out of my own way, and agreed on
the choice. It turns out, I LOVE the album! It’s one of the most intriguing
things I’ve ever heard. As if that wasn’t enough of a surprise, I found out
that In A Silent Way is supposed to be the first fusion album Miles recorded.
. . I was confused, “Wait, aren’t I suppose to hate fusion jazz? But this
sounds so good. How come?”. After a few seconds of thinking about it, the
music took over and it didn’t matter anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmQwzAsOw1k">The album</a> itself is wonderful!
It’s dreamy, contemplative, other-worldly, melancholic, magical and even dark.
I don’t know if I’ve mentioned this before, but I’ve always been fascinated by
dreams and everything related to them. So it’s probably just me, but I feel
like this whole album is about dreams, which is why I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>The first song, Shhh/Peaceful, starts off with just the drums, organ, piano,
bass and guitar letting you look around and get the feeling of what the song
is going to look like. They set the stage for Miles, and when he comes in, he
glides on top of that background, as smooth as ever. Listen to his tone and
articulation. He’s got such control over his instrument, it sounds like it’s
not just a trumpet, but an extension of his thoughts.</p>

<p>The song then goes on and develops like dreams do. And you know how in dreams
something’s always off and even though you’re somehow aware of it, everything
feels just right anyway. Well, listen how the drums provide a really groovy
and quite powerful beat, but the music itself is so mellow and gentle. At
first it sounds a bit off, but after awhile it just feels right.</p>

<p>Another correlation between this song and dreams is how many details the sound
has. No matter where you look, there’s always a detail you didn’t hear before.</p>

<p>The song continues making an impression like that until, just after becoming
slightly turbulent, it rolls off.</p>

<p>At this point, I was already totally in awe, but there was another part, just
as good as the first one. What a treat!</p>

<p>The second song, In a Silent Way/It’s About That Time, begins so darn
beautifully! It sounds so optimistic and hopeful, something like a beautiful
landscape after a storm. After you get a chance to really hear this gorgeous
sound, the flow changes quite abruptly and they start building on top of that.
It feels like this beautiful music is delicate and sensitive, since after a
slight change, everything follows. I guess it sounds like, what I think a
development of an idea in someone’s mind would sound like - from that first
inkling to a full-blown idea. In any case, an amazing second part to this
unbelievable album.</p>

<p>Listening to and thinking about this album was a really wonderful experience.
I sat in a cozy chair, dimmed the lights and set the music to a comfortable
volume. Then I listened. . . I mean really listened. I was shocked by how many
things I could actually hear. If I had listened to this about a year ago, I
would have thought it’s nonsense. I guess I must have had some kind of
invisible earplugs in my ears.</p>

<p>Forty minutes of this dreamy music went by like four minutes. The whole album
is filled with so many thoughts, feelings and emotions, I found myself
thinking about it for some time after it stopped playing. And I love how great
music inspires me to listen to even more music, which is exactly what happened
in the next few days.</p>

<p>I suggest you give In a Silent Way a listen as well. Don’t think about it too
much, just listen and let yourself feel the wonders of music.</p>

    <p><img src="/img/2Fwp-content2Fuploads2F20112F042FBen-Harper-There-will-be-a-light.jpeg" alt="" />
Two months ago I began making some decisions about my
studies and consequently I was focusing on college and neglected my blog and
photography. I’ve simply put it on hold. I thought I didn’t miss it that much,
but then, a couple of days ago, I was reading one of my older posts. It made
me remember why I started writing in the first place. I mean I enjoy just
listening to music, but writing about it gives me something more. It makes me
more aware of how passionate I actually am about music and I love that
feeling. So here I am again, writing after a (too) long break. For the past
few weeks I’ve also started doing something new - I committed to listening 2
new albums every week, which means I definitely won’t run out of stuff to
write about.</p>

<p>Enough about that, let me talk about what I’m here to talk about. In 2004 Ben
Harper and the Blind Boys of Alabama recorded an album called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDIE7Y/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDIE7Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20">There Will Be A Light</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000TDIE7Y" alt="" />. It is one of my
favourite albums of all time and one of the best collaboration albums I know.
I’ve always been completely blown away by good collaborations. It’s simply
beyond me how two groups are able to melt into one so completely so that they
don’t sound like two separate groups, while at the same time, retain and show
what each makes them unique. And it all fits together perfectly! It’s nothing
short of magical. The reason I’m bringing this up is because the way Ben
Harper and the Blind Boys Of Alabama work together on these 11 songs is an
epitome of what I’m trying to say.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fserve2F_2F297629192FBen2BHarper2BAnd2BThe2BBlind2BBoys2BOf2BAlabama.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before I listened to this album, I knew Ben Harper’s music as quite eclectic,
but the part I was interested in was a mixture of indie, rock, folk and maybe
blues, with most of his songs being introspective and somewhat melancholic.
Which I love. Here are a few great songs, so you can hear what I mean.</p>

<p>The Blind Boys of Alabama is a gospel
group that’s been active for well over 70 years now and they’re one of the
best in their field. And if you’re wondering, yes, they’re actually blind
(apart from one member I believe). They were performing in Ljubljana a couple
of years ago and I really regret not seeing them - at that time I had no idea
who they are. Now I can’t think of any other group that would make this album
as powerful as it is now.</p>

<p>Seven of the songs on the album are written by Ben, specifically for this
occasion. The rest are traditional gospel tunes and covers (keep an eye on Bob
Dylan’s Well, Well, Well). The moment I heard the first song of the album,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FALuWDPOLdg">Take My Hand</a>, I knew I was in
for a treat. What an understatement that proved to be. The album is just that
good!</p>

<p>The Blind Boys of Alabama create a basis on which Ben flourishes. They provide
a background that’s rich, joyful and full of faith to his emotional, honest
and heartwarming singing. Add to that a great instrumental accompaniment and
you get this incredible piece of music. Here are, in my opinion, the
highlights of the album:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2Fimages2Fstories2Fmarch20032Fapril20102Fmay20102Fjune20102Fblind2520boys2520of2520alabama252001.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The title song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-lHWmpVxzk">There Will Be a
Light</a>. No words needed here. Just
listen and feel it.</p>

<p>Powerful rendition of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPn8ivGUVG0">Well, Well,
Well</a> with some crazy guitar work
on 11th commandment before that.</p>

<p>The a cappella song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca1vnGfIWVo">If I Could Hear My Mother Pray
Again</a>, is simply haunting. It’s
amazing that a human voice without any instruments to back it up is capable of
creating such an emotional work of art. Probably my favourite song of the
album - the Blind Boys Of Alabama at their best, if you ask me.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you love it as much as I do? Do you agree that their
collaboration on this album is perfect?</p>

<p>Until next time…</p>

<p>P.S. Does anyone have any requests for what you would like to see me write
about next time?</p>

<p>Next up in this women in jazz series is the magnificent Ella Fitzgerald. I
feel a bit intimidated writing about her - she was just that good! Her voice
is probably as pure as it gets. It’s bright, perfectly clear and it’s very
comforting. Her singing is so effortless that she makes it seem like it’s easy
to sing like that. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to have Ella for
a grandma. Whenever someone felt blue, she would just sing their troubles
away. While I love <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a> and <a href="/2012/11/20/Dinah-Washington/">Dinah
Washington</a>, they never make me feel as good as Ella always does. It’s
easy to get caught up in her music and forget about your worries.  </p>

<p>I got to know Ella through my love of Louis Armstrong. As you may know, Lady
Ella and Satchmo recorded 3 albums together, all of which are simply golden.
Some people refer to ‘Porgy and Bess’ album as “Sandpaper and whipped cream”.
I personally prefer the first two albums - ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RD5E/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00004RD5E">Ella &amp; Louis</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00004RD5E" alt="" />’
and ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084H9J/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000084H9J">Ella andLouis Again</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000084H9J" alt="" />’
. A combination of her singing and her exquisite voice, his amazing trumpet playing and his raspy
voice is entrancing. Listen to ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmoiGZuiFQ">They Can’t Take That Away From
Me</a>’ or ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtG9CnMtzZk">Learning The
Blues</a>’ to get a feeling of what
I’m talking about. And even if you’re not interested in what I’m talking
about, just listen to the songs because it’s wonderful music and also because
these albums are probably an example of one of the best collaborations ever.<br />
For some other Ella Fitzgerald’s albums, I would recommend ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000479L/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000479L">Intimate Ella</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00000479L" alt="" />’ or
some of her songbooks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKYZK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0034JKYZK">Cole Porter’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0034JKYZK" alt="" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000006P6L/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000006P6L">Gershwin’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000006P6L" alt="" /> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LOYS8Y/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001LOYS8Y">Duke 
Ellington’s</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001LOYS8Y" alt="" />. The first two are
actually not even that jazzy, so they might be especially appropriate for
someone who’s not that into jazz, but because of Ella’s amazing vocals they
will also be liked by jazz fans. ‘Intimate Ella’ is a good one to get the most
out of her voice, since she’s accompanied only by a piano on this one. Here’s
an example.  </p>

<p>I read about her life the other day and I was quite surprised. Ella was born
and brought up in poverty and she was actually homeless for a year before
starting her career. She hit her big break at a talent show in Harlem. She was
supposed to dance, but after seeing an amazing dance act go on before her, she
got scared and at the last second decided to sing instead. Best last second
decision ever!<br />
Behind the stage, she was actually shy and reserved, which I think no one
would guess because she looked so confident and, in her own words, felt at
home on the stage. Singing is what she lived for. She often felt self-
conscious about her looks and at times even doubted her abilities. How can
someone so talented doubt themselves?! I guess she was still only a human,
like the rest of us, even though she sounded otherworldly.  </p>

<p>What is your favourite Ella Fitzgerald album or song? Your thoughts are
appreciated.</p>

<p>Today, my two greatest passions in music are definitely Jazz and Blues. But it
wasn’t always so and there are two musicians who got me interested in this
music and ushered me to a whole new musical world - just as Louis Armstrong
kindled my passion for jazz, Robert Johnson did so with the blues.<br />
The first time I heard his music, I was blown away. I only heard one song and
already knew that this is what I’ve been looking for. I was mesmerized by the
raw emotion conveyed within the song. I haven’t heard anything quite like it
before. The singing, the guitar… it was all so powerful. And the reason I
can remember all of this so clearly is because nothing has changed - the
moment I put on Robert Johnson, I feel exactly like I did the first time I
heard him. The only difference is, that with every listening, I hear more and
more nuances in his music. Listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4up4VP8zjyc">Come On In My
Kitchen</a> and how he plays melody
and rhythm at the same time on his guitar, and all the while he delivers this
amazing singing, like it’s not even a big deal. Or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It-tJ8DOjIk">Terraplane
Blues</a>, where it almost sounds
like there’s more than one guitar playing (it’s all just him, fyi). But maybe
don’t even listen to that, just listen to the emotion and the feeling of the
songs. You don’t need to know anything about music for this to blow you away,
just be open to it. Huh, I get excited about Robert Johnson, I need to calm
down.<br />
So who is Robert Johnson? Let’s put on a song first, before we get started.  </p>

<p>Of all the bluesmen, Robert Johnson’s life is probably the one shrouded in
mystery the most. Robert Leroy Johnson was born in 1911, in a small town
Hazlehurst, Mississippi. He developed an affection for music as a teenager and
started playing a harmonica. When he was around 19, he took interest in guitar
and started playing that instead. Around the same time, his wife died in
childbirth, which made him turn to his music that much more. He was learning
from any source he could get his hands on, and it was obvious that he was
still just learning. His most important mentor and source of inspiration was a
bluesman, Ike Zinnerman. It’s been told that they were playing their guitars
late every night in graveyards on tombstones, where no one would bother them.
If he wasn’t with Ike, Robert would go to the woods by himself, where he was
trying to learn everything he could about the guitar. After a couple of years
he started travelling around the state to play around different juke joints.
The musicians that had heard him when he was still just learning, were amazed.
They could not believe what kind of progress he made and how his abilities
suddenly surpassed their own.<br />
Because of his talent and because he played all the time and everywhere, he
quickly became famous around those parts. He played with many musicians and he
left a mark on most of them. He played in places, where they requested all
kinds of different songs, so he developed an amazing ability, where he had to
hear a song only once before he was able to play it. He could be deep in a
debate with a friend, with music playing in the background, and without ever
stopping the conversation, he could play and sing the song perfectly
afterwards. That helped him with a well-rounded repertoire for his gigs.  </p>

<p>Robert had a big appetite for women, and women were crazy about him. He had a
habit of finding a woman in any town he went to, who would give him food,
money and a place to stay. His lust eventually killed him. One time, while
playing in a bar, he was flirting with a woman for the whole night. What he
didn’t realize, was that it was the owner’s wife. The owner was furious to see
this, so he put poison in young Robert’s drink, which killed him.  </p>

<p>That’s one way of telling the story. The other (which makes much more sense,
if you ask me) goes like this: an aspiring young musician wants to become
famous and is willing to do anything for it. He tries really hard but his
desire is greater than his patience. One day he finds out, that if he goes to
a certain crossroad at midnight, he’ll meet someone who can help him. And
that’s exactly what he does. At the crossroads he meets a tall dark man, who
tunes his guitar, plays a song or two, and gives it back to him. And with
that, the deal is struck - Mr Johnson sells his soul to the Devil, in exchange
for the incredible musical abilities and renown. He goes back to the musicians
that taught him to play and surprises everyone with his skills. He’s
unbeatable. But there was another part to the deal - a couple of years later
the Devil gets his toll. Robert Johnson gets killed by the age of 27.  </p>

<p>No matter what story you believe in, Robert Johnson’s music is simply amazing
and incredibly influential. Apart from some testimonies about his life, 3
photos of him and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OFWLO0/r

amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004OFWLO0" alt="" /> (with alternate
takes it adds up to 41 recordings) are all we are left with. Thankfully, the
depth of his music makes that plenty.  </p>

<p>Robert Johnson is my favourite bluesman of all times, so I wanted the post
about him to be really good. Otherwise I would feel I’m not doing him justice
(and even now I’m nervous because I want to make sure that doesn’t happen).
Therefore, I’m doing it in two stages, with this post serving as an
introduction to the post I’ll do in a couple of days.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brian Jones had the first album, and that’s where I first heard it. I’d just
met Brian, and I went around to his apartment-crash pad, actually, all he had
in it was a chair, a record player, and a few records. One of which was Robert
Johnson. He put it on, and it was just-you know-astounding stuff. When I first
heard it, I said to Brian, “Who’s that?” “Robert Johnson”. I said, “Yeah, but
who’s the other guy playing with him?” Because I was hearing two guitars, and
it took me a long time to realize he was actually doing it all by himself.<br />
I’ve never heard anybody before or since use the form and bend it quite so
much to make it work for himself. The quality of the songs themselves-I mean,
he came out with such compelling themes, they were actual songs as well as
just being the blues. The songs and the subject matter, just the way they were
treated, apart from the music and the performance. And the guitar playing-it
was almost like listening to Bach. You know, you think you’re getting a handle
on playing the blues, and then you hear Robert Johnson-some of the rhythms
he’s doing and playing and singing at the same time, you think, “This guy must
have three brains!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>To me Robert Johnson’s influence-he was like a comet or a meteor that came
along and, BOOM, suddenly he raised the ante, suddenly you just had to aim
that much higher. You can put the record on now, and it’s as fresh and
interesting as the first day you heard it. Everybody should know about Robert
Johnson. When you know about something, and comperatively few other people
know about it, that’s a crime in a way; you’ve got to do what you can to tell
people, “Hey, check this cat out. Because you’re in for something extra in
your life.” You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>by Keith Richards</em>  </p>

<p>Come back in a couple of days - you’re in for something extra in your life,
as Keith put it. Since it’s Robert Johnson, I couldn’t agree more.  </p>

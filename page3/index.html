<p>Roberta Flack</p>

<p>Ugh, I haven’t posted in almost two weeks now, it’s almost like I slept
through the holidays. Anyway I’m back now, so let’s get right to it.  </p>

<p>Roberta Flack, there’s an amazing singer! I’m not sure why I haven’t written
about her in <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/search/label/Women">my women in jazz
series</a>, but I’m
making up for it now. I was introduced to her music by a good friend last year
and I’m still grateful.<br />
Roberta Flack is a singer and a songwriter, born in 1939 and most notably
known for her hits in the 70’s. If you’ve never heard of her, you probably
know her by her famous “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1eOsMc2Fgg">Killing Me Softly With His
Song</a>”, which won her a Grammy in
1974. Another quite renowned song she recorded is “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOFrGbuUqnQ">The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face</a>”.<br />
I don’t care too much for either of these songs and I’m not sure why. I guess
they just don’t move me. But I do love and respect Roberta and the reason for
that is her first three albums - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product

/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000002I60" alt="" /> and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KRTA4G/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UT
F8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004

amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004KRTA4G" alt="" />. They’re soft,
sophisticated and soulful. In life in general, I appreciate things that slowly
build up to their peak, may that be in music, movies, books, shows or food. I
feel that if something builds up to its full intensity gradually, it’s much
more powerful than it would be, if it was as forceful from the very beginning.
And I’m saying this, because I think songs in these albums provide just that -
a wonderful slow build-up. That, of course, doesn’t mean there’s not much
happening, it means they’re really powerful and strong.<br />
Her music on these albums is like the ocean waves hitting the shore - at first
glance it seems slow, quiet and serene but in reality it has so much power and
energy.<br />
These three albums are amazing and I highly recommend them. Here are two songs
to get a feeling of what kind of music to expect.  </p>

<p>Roberta is still creating new music. Just last year she recorded an album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/produ
ct/B00687XM22/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1
789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00687XM22">Let
It Be Roberta: Roberta Flack Sings The Beatles</a><img src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00687XM22" alt="" />. I really like The
Beatles and I used to be obsessed with them so when I saw that she made an
album full of their songs I was excited. As soon as I started listening to the
album, the excitement was replaced with disappointment. With the exception of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ZqvbQw-YY&amp;feature=youtu.be">one song</a>, it’s
an awful album (at least to my ears anyway). You know, how sometimes older
people try to sound young and hip but they end up just sounding awkward? Well
that’s how I feel about this album. It sounds like she did some stuff on it
just because “it’s what young people listen to these days”, instead of doing
her own thing. For the better part of the album I was shaking my head, and
asking myself “why?”. As much as I enjoy Roberta’s early music, this is one
album I probably won’t listen to again.  </p>

<p>What do you think? Do you have a Roberta Flack favourite? As always, I really
appreciate any kind of comments.</p>

<p>De-Lovely</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, I watched a movie about an amazing American songwriter
Cole Porter, called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352277/">De-Lovely</a>. To
anyone who’s never heard of Cole Porter before: he was a prolific composer,
famous for his Broadway shows and his numerous jazz standards. He was
something special for writing both lyrics and music for his songs, which was a
rarity at that time. He had an amazing ability to come up with genius, funny,
witty lyrics, often full of innuendos, always accompanied by beautiful
melodies. Anybody, who was ever somebody in Jazz, recorded songs by Cole
Porter at one point or another in their career - from <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-first-lady-
of-song.html">Ella
Fitzgerald</a>, Louis Armstrong, <a href="http://musiceverlastingmusic.blogspot.com/2012/10/fine-and-
mellow.html">Billie
Holiday</a> to Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Oscar Peterson and many others.
And to anyone familiar with Cole: even if you’re only remotely interested in
Mr Porter, this is a movie you cannot miss! After watching the movie, I
started understanding his songs much better and I started noticing more
important details in his music and intricate lyrics.<br />
The movie starts at the end of Cole Porter’s life, with the dying songwriter
retrospecting on his life, but observing it as if it was a musical. It’s a
great concept that fits perfectly to his life and music. The story talks about
his life, his indulgence and his very interesting relationship with his wife,
Linda. It features great performances by Robbie Williams, Alanis Morissette,
Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Natalie Cole and others. It’s truly
a great biopic, which reveals new dimensions to the irreplaceable Cole Porter.
The only criticism I have is that the movie starts and ends with a great
rhythm, but somewhere in the middle seems to slow down a bit, which makes it
feel a bit inconsistent. But seeing as how great the movie is overall, this is
hardly an important remark.<br />
I highly recommend the movie to anyone interested in music or anyone simply
looking for a good story. In case you like it, I suggest you get Ella
Fitzgerald’s <a href="http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B0034JKYZK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkC
ode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0034JKYZK">Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook</a><img src="http://www.assoc-

afterwards. Her renditions are simply beautiful and it’s a great way to start
getting into Cole’s music.<br />
Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY/ref=as_li_tf_t

possible. You won’t be sorry. Enjoy and come back afterwards to tell me what
you thought! I’d love to hear your comments.  </p>

<p>Robert Johnson</p>

<p>Today, my two greatest passions in music are definitely Jazz and Blues. But it
wasn’t always so and there are two musicians who got me interested in this
music and ushered me to a whole new musical world - just as Louis Armstrong
kindled my passion for jazz, Robert Johnson did so with the blues.<br />
The first time I heard his music, I was blown away. I only heard one song and
already knew that this is what I’ve been looking for. I was mesmerized by the
raw emotion conveyed within the song. I haven’t heard anything quite like it
before. The singing, the guitar… it was all so powerful. And the reason I
can remember all of this so clearly is because nothing has changed - the
moment I put on Robert Johnson, I feel exactly like I did the first time I
heard him. The only difference is, that with every listening, I hear more and
more nuances in his music. Listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4up4VP8zjyc">Come On In My
Kitchen</a> and how he plays melody
and rhythm at the same time on his guitar, and all the while he delivers this
amazing singing, like it’s not even a big deal. Or maybe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It-tJ8DOjIk">Terraplane
Blues</a>, where it almost sounds
like there’s more than one guitar playing (it’s all just him, fyi). But maybe
don’t even listen to that, just listen to the emotion and the feeling of the
songs. You don’t need to know anything about music for this to blow you away,
just be open to it. Huh, I get excited about Robert Johnson, I need to calm
down.<br />
So who is Robert Johnson? Let’s put on a song first, before we get started.  </p>

<p>Of all the bluesmen, Robert Johnson’s life is probably the one shrouded in
mystery the most. Robert Leroy Johnson was born in 1911, in a small town
Hazlehurst, Mississippi. He developed an affection for music as a teenager and
started playing a harmonica. When he was around 19, he took interest in guitar
and started playing that instead. Around the same time, his wife died in
childbirth, which made him turn to his music that much more. He was learning
from any source he could get his hands on, and it was obvious that he was
still just learning. His most important mentor and source of inspiration was a
bluesman, Ike Zinnerman. It’s been told that they were playing their guitars
late every night in graveyards on tombstones, where no one would bother them.
If he wasn’t with Ike, Robert would go to the woods by himself, where he was
trying to learn everything he could about the guitar. After a couple of years
he started travelling around the state to play around different juke joints.
The musicians that had heard him when he was still just learning, were amazed.
They could not believe what kind of progress he made and how his abilities
suddenly surpassed their own.<br />
Because of his talent and because he played all the time and everywhere, he
quickly became famous around those parts. He played with many musicians and he
left a mark on most of them. He played in places, where they requested all
kinds of different songs, so he developed an amazing ability, where he had to
hear a song only once before he was able to play it. He could be deep in a
debate with a friend, with music playing in the background, and without ever
stopping the conversation, he could play and sing the song perfectly
afterwards. That helped him with a well-rounded repertoire for his gigs.  </p>

<p>Robert had a big appetite for women, and women were crazy about him. He had a
habit of finding a woman in any town he went to, who would give him food,
money and a place to stay. His lust eventually killed him. One time, while
playing in a bar, he was flirting with a woman for the whole night. What he
didn’t realize, was that it was the owner’s wife. The owner was furious to see
this, so he put poison in young Robert’s drink, which killed him.  </p>

<p>That’s one way of telling the story. The other (which makes much more sense,
if you ask me) goes like this: an aspiring young musician wants to become
famous and is willing to do anything for it. He tries really hard but his
desire is greater than his patience. One day he finds out, that if he goes to
a certain crossroad at midnight, he’ll meet someone who can help him. And
that’s exactly what he does. At the crossroads he meets a tall dark man, who
tunes his guitar, plays a song or two, and gives it back to him. And with
that, the deal is struck - Mr Johnson sells his soul to the Devil, in exchange
for the incredible musical abilities and renown. He goes back to the musicians
that taught him to play and surprises everyone with his skills. He’s
unbeatable. But there was another part to the deal - a couple of years later
the Devil gets his toll. Robert Johnson gets killed by the age of 27.  </p>

<p>No matter what story you believe in, Robert Johnson’s music is simply amazing
and incredibly influential. Apart from some testimonies about his life, 3
photos of him and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OFWLO0/r
ef=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythougonmusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;cre

amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004OFWLO0" alt="" /> (with alternate
takes it adds up to 41 recordings) are all we are left with. Thankfully, the
depth of his music makes that plenty.  </p>

<p>Robert Johnson</p>

<p>Robert Johnson is my favourite bluesman of all times, so I wanted the post
about him to be really good. Otherwise I would feel I’m not doing him justice
(and even now I’m nervous because I want to make sure that doesn’t happen).
Therefore, I’m doing it in two stages, with this post serving as an
introduction to the post I’ll do in a couple of days.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brian Jones had the first album, and that’s where I first heard it. I’d just
met Brian, and I went around to his apartment-crash pad, actually, all he had
in it was a chair, a record player, and a few records. One of which was Robert
Johnson. He put it on, and it was just-you know-astounding stuff. When I first
heard it, I said to Brian, “Who’s that?” “Robert Johnson”. I said, “Yeah, but
who’s the other guy playing with him?” Because I was hearing two guitars, and
it took me a long time to realize he was actually doing it all by himself.<br />
I’ve never heard anybody before or since use the form and bend it quite so
much to make it work for himself. The quality of the songs themselves-I mean,
he came out with such compelling themes, they were actual songs as well as
just being the blues. The songs and the subject matter, just the way they were
treated, apart from the music and the performance. And the guitar playing-it
was almost like listening to Bach. You know, you think you’re getting a handle
on playing the blues, and then you hear Robert Johnson-some of the rhythms
he’s doing and playing and singing at the same time, you think, “This guy must
have three brains!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>To me Robert Johnson’s influence-he was like a comet or a meteor that came
along and, BOOM, suddenly he raised the ante, suddenly you just had to aim
that much higher. You can put the record on now, and it’s as fresh and
interesting as the first day you heard it. Everybody should know about Robert
Johnson. When you know about something, and comperatively few other people
know about it, that’s a crime in a way; you’ve got to do what you can to tell
people, “Hey, check this cat out. Because you’re in for something extra in
your life.” You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>by Keith Richards</em>  </p>

<p>Come back in a couple of days - you’re in for something extra in your life,
as Keith put it. Since it’s Robert Johnson, I couldn’t agree more.  </p>

<p>Solomon Burke</p>

<p>Solomon Burke, also known as the king of Rock’ n’ Soul,  was a phenomenal
singer full of energy, one of the pioneers of Soul music and also an
overlooked musical talent. For most people the name won’t ring any bells, but
I’m sure a lot of you know him even though you don’t realize. Some people
might know him through <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbK5tgjA38">The</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbK5tgjA38">
Rolling Stones</a>, who covered his
‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OKAlBC-
XWQ">Everybody Needs Somebody To Love</a>’, or maybe through the movie Blues Brothers which also contains this
song, others will know him through the Dirty Dancing soundtrack and ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEu8DrO9PbY">Cry To
me</a>’ and some might have seen him
on <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-
time-19691231/solomon-burke-20101202">Rolling Stone list of Top 100 singers of all
time</a>. But whether you know him or not, he’ll
always be one of the greatest Soul singers of all time.  </p>

<p>I’m a big fan of his music and his rich singing. I think it embodies exactly
the things I love about Soul music. I love how he can sing either gently and
slowly or enthusiastically and with so much force it could satisfy any kind of
audience. But either way, his singing is always powerful and full of emotion
and intricacies. I’ve been listening to his music for many years now, and at
the end of 2009, I saw that he was doing a tour around Europe. I was looking
at the tickets for the shows near Slovenia, but ultimately, I said to myself
“ah, I can’t do it this time, I’m sure he’ll be back again and I’ll go then”.
Well, in 2010 he passed away and to this day not seeing him live is still one
of the greatest regrets I’ve ever had. Today I enjoy his music more than ever,
but the way I decided not to see him there and then is on my mind whenever I
listen to him.  </p>

<p>You can easily find his big songs from the 60’s on one of different <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000346M/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mythou

compilations (which is definitely worth having) but if there’s one album I
would recommend to anyone, it has to be <a href="http://www.amazo

people who don’t enjoy this kind of music will like it. I absolutely love this
album and it’s one of my favourite albums ever. I like how it’s so fresh every
time I listen to it. For example, I listened to it two days ago (after
listening to it many times before, of course) and hearing it today, it feels
like I’ve heard it for the first time again. It was recorded in 2002 and it
was a great comeback for Solomon and also a great comeback for old style Soul
music. He proved that he hasn’t lost any of the energy he had in his prime
era. Some great songwriters wrote all of the songs for this album,
specifically for Solomon. All of them are great fans of his and some of these
songwriters are Bob Dylan, Nick Lowe, Brian Wilson (from the Beach Boys), Van
Morrison, Tom Waits and Elvis Costello. Listen to this great song to either
get a feeling of the album or to just hear an amazing song and an amazing
vocalist.  </p>

<p>Do you like it? What do you think? As always, I would love to hear your
thoughts on the matter.</p>
